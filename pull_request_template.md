### Thank you for submitting a pull request!

Before I (Vega) can merge your content I just need to deal with how to license and credit your contribution.

> **Huh?**
>
> If you have no idea what this means and don't care, putting your work into the public domain, option one, is probably what you want. That just means that anyone can use what you contributed anywhere without permission or attribution. Unless your contribution is extremely minor, I will still give you credit on the front page of OpGuides.

> If that doesn't sit well with you, then you probably want to go with the second option which requires that I or anyone using your work give you credit, share their changes, and get permission from either me (or someone acting on my behalf) OR you directly before using the content to make money (typically for covering the cost of hosting the website + proving incentive to keep making more content)

#### First things first,

- [ ] Everything I'm contributing is my own work, used with permission (and attributed as necessary), or is very clearly [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)

***Not* checking this box does not mean I will deny your pull request outright**, it just means we may need to have a look at how likely we are to be called out on using whatever content you've used.

#### Pick one of these 3 Options:

##### 1) Public Domain

- [ ] I agree to put my contribution into the Public Domain (or CC-0, if that doesn't apply where you are)

- [ ] (not required) **I would like to be credited as:** ________ on the OpGuides Homepage

  > Note, if I feel your contribution is minor (like you corrected a single typo) I may not put your name on the home page

##### 2) CC-NC-BY-SA 4.0 With Exceptions

- [ ] I agree that my content will be licensed as [CC-NC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

- [ ] I agree that acknowledgment of contribution on the homepage of OpGuides or any fork is sufficient for fulfilling the obligation in the license to provide credit to my contributions (your name doesn't need to appear on the same page as your contribution)

  **I would like to be credited as:** ________ on the OpGuides Homepage

- [ ] I agree that Vega can still collect donations though the site (an exception to the 'NC' terms of the license)

- [ ] I agree that Vega or one other person - "The Backup" - Vega appoints at a time may grant this same exception to those wishing to host a fork of OpGudides themselves. In the event that Vega is unable to grant this exception further, the last person appointed "The Backup" becomes the copyright holder of the OpGuides name, logo, Interviews, and blog posts and may appoint a new "The Backup" for the same purpose.

##### 3) Copyright Assignment

- [ ] I agree to assign the copyright of this contribution to Vega

  > Your content will still be licensed [CC-NC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/); however, as the copyright owner I (Vega) can grant the exceptions, transfer of ownership, etc. as necessary. Be aware that this technically means the license *could* be changed to something more restrictive later even though I have no intent to do so at this time.
  >
  > I only recommend this option if your contribution is minor OR you have some reason to not want your contribution in the public domain and you don't wish to agree to the terms in the previous option

### And Done!

If you have any questions about the license or have any concerns about your PR, please don't hesitate to ask!
