# Copyright

OpGuides links to and re-hosts a bunch of other content. If you don't want your content shown here please submit an issue or just poke me on Twitter. I have done my best to ask for permission where necessary when other resources are used.

As for the license, everything on OpGuides **except** 

* The images, quotes, videos, and code that are marked as being from elsewhere or are dynamically loaded from other sources (YouTube, Twitter embeds, Javascript, and the like)

  **Why:** Nobody has the right to re-license another person's hard work

* The OpGuides name and Logo

  **Why:** To avoid confusion

* The Interviews section (https://opguides.info/interviews/*)

  **Why:** Other people should have the right to know where their interviews are hosted and request they be removed

* The Blog Section (https://opguides.info/posts/*)

  **Why:** Many of the posts are about my life, copying them is just weird

* Images of the character 'Vega Deftwing'

  **Why:** I shouldn't have to have my likeness on a page with content I don't get a say in

* Resources given special permission by the artist for OpGuides (all are located in `static/nonfree/permissiongranted`)

  **Why**: Permission was given for OpGuides, but not for an arbitrary website

is licensed under [CC-NC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), with the a few extra stipulations

* Contributors must agree that I (Vega) can still collect donations though the site - at the moment this is though Github Sponsors and Venmo, though this may change in the future. This covers the cost of the domain, and gives me a little spending money to justify purchases that allow me to write further content.
* Contributors also agree that I (Vega) or one other person - "The Backup" - I appoint at a time may grant this same exception to those wishing to host a fork of OpGudides themselves. In the event that I am unable to grant this exception further, the last person appointed "The Backup" becomes the copyright holder of the OpGuides name, logo, Interviews, and blog posts and may appoint a new "The Backup".
  * Currently Soatok Dreamseeker of https://soatok.blog is "The Backup"

What this means is you are welcome to fork the project; *however,* if you want to host it yourself you'll need to remove the `nonfree` folder of content in the `static` folder at the base of this repo. If you'd like to collect donations (to cover the cost of hosting and encourage development) you'll need to ask for an exception from me (Vega). This exception will almost certainly be granted if you've put in any more work than just changing the logo around and removing the nonfree folder.

It is worth noting that a fair amount of content on OpGuides is presented under the assumption of fair use, some of this done more liberally than it probably should be. Many images on OpGuides are used because of broad permission granting statements on the authors websites such as the statements from [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/about/) and [Sarah Scribbles](https://sarahcandersen.com/about). Some images are almost certainly violations of copyright, but exist under the same gray area that has let meme and [gif culture](https://fortune.com/2016/11/07/giphy-gifs-copyright/) flourish. If you plan to host a fork of OpGuides you may want to consider your own level of comfort regarding the usage of this content and change pages as necessary.
