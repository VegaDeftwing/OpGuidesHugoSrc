# Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Repair

TODO: Contextual use of resources. https://andymasley.substack.com/p/individual-ai-use-is-not-bad-for

High power usage isn't where people think, leaving something on vs brief period of high power, wireless chargers, etc.

It's frustrating that you can't buy things to repair things in person, due to online shopping and markets

Online markets also have negative effects on the quality of goods, since you can inspect them first so it's all a race to the bottom in price

It also causes fraudulent parts and supply chain issues

In school, *in the US, **to my knowledge, kids are still taught Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.

Some problems with that:<footnote>At least to me, others may not have the same mental associations with the words, so I guess this is anecdotal</footnote>

1. Reduce mental implies less, not 0.
2. Reuse implies accepting the end of life and finding a secondary purpose, while still replacing.

Making it 5 R's, adding Refuse and Repair, I think fixes those.



BIG disclaimer that while there's some personal responsibility, the vast, vast majority isn't individual. Call congress critters when applicable



## Refuse

Not just free stuff, but also to buy things that don't try to be long term or repairable. Try to care about packaging

In digital spaces, "refuse" can mean declining to use services, apps, or platforms that exploit user data, are overly resource-heavy, or propagate unethical practices (such as surveillance capitalism). It also involves opting out of spammy or irrelevant content, ads, or online distractions that donâ€™t contribute value.

## Reduce

Hacking away batteries, setting up timers, phone to 2nd screen

Not using bloated frameworks, keep shit simple.

Turn things to low power states when idle.

## Reuse

Buy used tech, look for older stuff where open source projects might let you work with it when others may not be able to.



Digitally, old software can still be used in new ways, saving man hours.



## Recycle

It shouldn't be news to anyone that a lot of recycling is bullshit.



You can turn old hardware into something useful though, like old computers into servers or media centers.



The hard part here, IMHO, is getting power consumption reasonable. Often new hardware is more environmentally friendly and will pay for itself (This needs fact checked) because it uses so much less power.

## Repair

Right to repair, fix bugs and keep old software working.

RE: That big anti-corpo spheel at the start of this page. You may feel powerless, but you can take direct action.

Call your congress critters. Don't buy from Amazon. [Don't *just* Block Ads, click em' all.](https://adnauseam.io)

This includes advocating for open standards, data privacy, and user rights. It can mean standing against planned obsolescence in software and hardware or supporting movements toward decentralized systems like the Fediverse or self-hosted alternatives to mainstream tech giants.
