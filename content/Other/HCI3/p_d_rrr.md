# Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Repair

TODO: Contextual use of resources. https://andymasley.substack.com/p/individual-ai-use-is-not-bad-for

High power usage isn't where people think, leaving something on vs brief period of high power, wireless chargers, etc.

It's frustrating that you can't buy things to repair things in person, due to online shopping and markets

Online markets also have negative effects on the quality of goods, since you can inspect them first so it's all a race to the bottom in price

It also causes fraudulent parts and supply chain issues

In school, *in the US, **to my knowledge, kids are still taught Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.

Some problems with that:<footnote>At least to me, others may not have the same mental associations with the words, so I guess this is anecdotal</footnote>

1. **Reduce** mentally implies less, not 0.
2. **Reuse** implies accepting the end of life and finding a secondary purpose, while still replacing.

Making it 5 R's, adding **Refuse** and **Repair**, I think fixes those.

As a quick, big disclaimer: While there's some personal responsibility, the vast, vast majority isn't individual. Call you congress critters! Tell them that you support the right to repair. Tell them you want to see the government to support

### Software

I was in college during the height of COVID-19. While it was already gaining prevalance before, the pandemic made educational spyware for test taking much common. Before I started any classes for that online semester, I sent each professor for the classes I enrolled in an email, asking if this software was going to be used.

{{<details "Full Email Text, censoring the class name" >}}
> Hey there,
> I'm really looking forward to taking [Class Name], as it's a topic I am deeply interested in.
> 
> Unfortunately, I feel it necessary to preemptively ask all of my professors this semester if we'll be using Respondus or Proctorio at all for taking tests this semester, as I am so heavily against their use in education. If the answer is a quick and easy "no" that's great! If you did plan on using either or if you are interested in why I feel this way about these tools I hope you'll find the rest of this email enlightening.
> 
> First and foremost, they're just creepy. Taking tests at the DLC<footnote>The university I attended had a building called the "Digital Learning Commons" which had computers pre-loaded with this software</footnote> is fine with me because I know those computers are secure and dedicated to the single use. Respondus and Proctorio effectively amount to spyware that students are being asked to install onto their personal devices.
> 
> Second, they're both insecure. while this [1] article written by a friend of mine focuses on Proctorio, just doing a tiny bit of digging will turn up plenty on Respondus as well. So now it's not just spyware, but insecure spyware.
> 
> Third, they're a bit hyper-sensitive [2] [3]. I've read some articles where students even talking to themselves (which a lot of people do when alone and thinking hard!) have been flagged because the system thinks they're talking to someone else in the room.
> 
> This sensitivity is particularly bad when you consider many of the datasets used to train the algorithms that these programs use give the systems a racial bias [4].
>
> I also worry about my strange hardware setup. If these systems are looking for 'strange' I think my system with 30 usb devices, including 2 webcams, 2 mice, and 3 HID keyboards, would fit that bill. I don't want to have to rip my setup apart to take a test.
>
> They also depend on a strong internet connection. If I have a brief frame drop while my webcam is on and I'm taking a test, you may notice I freeze up and then start moving again. Responds may think I'm actively tampering with my webcam and tell you I'm doing something nefarious.
> 
> Fourth, all of the options I've seen (Proctorio, Respondus, etc.) are primarily available for Windows only, with some having OSx clients but none of them supporting Linux, which is the OS I normally use. Sure, I can boot into Windows, but some other students may be using chromebooks or only have Linux on their system.
> 
> Finally, there's a bit of a normalization of spyware that education using these tools can cause. This is bad for any student, but it's especially bad for CS and CE students who, lacking real ethics education at UNL, see this as an example. This makes software that has no right to exist look acceptable. For 'normies' it just further normalizes a category of software which is heavily used for domestic abuse, a stat that while I could site a source for, I can also tell you I've seen for myself multiple times.
> 
> I understand the need for secure, online testing, but this is certainly not the right solution.

I'll never forget the response I got from one of my professors:

> Short answer: no, I won't use them.
> 
> Slightly longer answer: I won't use them since there will be no exams or quizzes in this course.
>
> Even longer answer: Even if I did have exams or quizzes, there's no way in hell I'd use that awful, awful software. My conscience and my son would never forgive me.

Later that semester a different professor wanted to use this software. I showed that professor that reply, and it convinced him not to.

#### You Can Refuse.

You can refuse, and refuse loudly. When a site wants your data, don't just say no. Use [Adnauseam](https://adnauseam.io) to block the ads **and** feed their trackers fake data.

You can also use alternative apps. Don't use Adobe: use Krita or Affinity, for example. If a company is being shitty, don't give them your money.

### Application Specific Computers Are Wasteful

Study finds 70% of the energy a typical laptop will consume during its life span is used in manufacturing the computer

Do you know what makes an XBox or Playstation different from a gaming PC? 

Software. That's about it.

That software is often locked behind licence agreemets and digital rights management tools to lock it to that platform.

When companies try to sell you hardware for their software that could just run on a regular computer but wants you to buy yet another machine - a machine you can't upgrade and will innevitiebly be out of date, with no use but running old games - I would argue that if you want to play those games, you have a moral imperative to find a way (Emulators, etc.) to run them on your computer and to encourage others to do so as well.



Not just free stuff, but also to buy things that don't try to be long term or repairable. Try to care about packaging

In digital spaces, "refuse" can mean declining to use services, apps, or platforms that exploit user data, are overly resource-heavy, or propagate unethical practices (such as surveillance capitalism). It also involves opting out of spammy or irrelevant content, ads, or online distractions that don’t contribute value.

## Reduce

### Power Consumption... meh.

You'd think on a page as green-focused as this one, I'd talk more about saving electricity, but the fact is the amount a consumer uses basically doesn't matter compared to industrial users.

Really, there are only two reasons to care about power consumption:

1. You care about the environment and want to emit less carbon (Since there are emissions in the production of electricity)
2. You care about your bill, so want to use less kWh.

So back to (1.): who cares. If you've ever seen an oil mining flare - the bright light that looks like a second sun - you'd understand. In 2018 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas was flared off this way<footnote>
[Source for 5 trillion cubic feet](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2019/06/12/increased-shale-oil-production-and-political-conflict-contribute-to-increase-in-global-gas-flaring)</br>
[Conversion ratios for cubic feet to lbs](https://cimarron.com/conversion-of-volume-of-natural-gas-to-mass-of-natural-gas/)
</footnote>. Read that again. They just burnt it, directly into the atmosphere, because it's not worth anything.

In the US, each kWh generated emits ~0.81 lbs of CO2. An average home in the US uses 10,691kWh (again, per *home*, not per person, but let's just go with it)

But what about that burning?

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo separator="true" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">,</mo><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">,</mo><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">,</mo><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">,</mo><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mspace width="0.1667em"></mspace><msup><mtext>ft</mtext><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo separator="true" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">,</mo><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>&#xd7;</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>1</mn><mn>7</mn><mspace width="0.1667em"></mspace><mfrac><msub><mtext>lbs&#xa0;CO</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><mtext>MCF</mtext></mfrac><mo>&#xf7;</mo><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">,</mo><mn>2</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>4</mn><mi>.</mi><mn>6</mn><mn>2</mn><mspace width="0.1667em"></mspace><mfrac><mtext>lbs</mtext><mtext>metric&#xa0;ton</mtext></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mn>6</mn><mn>5</mn><mo separator="true" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">,</mo><mn>2</mn><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">,</mo><mn>2</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>7</mn><mspace width="0.1667em"></mspace><msub><mtext>metric&#xa0;tons&#xa0;CO</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math>

So the burning is equal to:

There are 147,000,000 homes in the US, so,

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mrow><mn>67,493,929</mn><mspace width="0.1667em"/><mtext>households&#xa0;of</mtext><mo>&#xa0;</mo><mi>C</mi><msub><mi>O</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mrow><mn>147</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>000</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>000</mn><mspace width="0.1667em"/><mtext>households&#xa0;in&#xa0;the&#xa0;US</mtext></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mo>.</mo><mn>459</mn></math>

So, flaring (world wide) alone in 2018 emitted ~46% as much CO₂ as powering every home in the U.S. for a year.

Again, flaring is complete and total waste of the resource. It's literally just making a big flame in the sky.

Now, this isn't meant to be a long post about why flaring is bad - I mean, it is, obviously - but the point is *as an individual* the power you use is relatively insignificant. 

Should you try to use less? **Yes.** 

Should the environmental harm of your electricicy use factor in nearly as much as all the other consumption of natural resources, plastic waste, etc? **Hell no.**

### Batteries



Hacking away batteries, setting up timers, phone to 2nd screen

Not using bloated frameworks, keep shit simple.

Turn things to low power states when idle.

## Reuse

Buy used tech, look for older stuff where open source projects might let you work with it when others may not be able to.



Digitally, old software can still be used in new ways, saving man hours.



## Recycle

It shouldn't be news to anyone that a lot of recycling is bullshit.



You can turn old hardware into something useful though, like old computers into servers or media centers.



The hard part here, IMHO, is getting power consumption reasonable. Often new hardware is more environmentally friendly and will pay for itself (This needs fact checked) because it uses so much less power.

## Repair

Right to repair, fix bugs and keep old software working.



## + Revolt

RE: That big anti-corpo spheel at the start of this page. You may feel powerless, but you can take direct action.

Call your congress critters. Don't buy from Amazon. [Don't *just* Block Ads, click em' all.](https://adnauseam.io)

This includes advocating for open standards, data privacy, and user rights. It can mean standing against planned obsolescence in software and hardware or supporting movements toward decentralized systems like the Fediverse or self-hosted alternatives to mainstream tech giants.
