# Two Conclusions

I started this series with lyrics to *Cognitive Dissonance Blues*, and I still feel that's appropriate. Seeing all the amazing things, proof that we can do better. Experiments that didn't just succeed but have actually persisted to make the lives of those that use them better is both incredibly inspiring and immensely frustrating.

{{< quote "Erik McClure in *[We Could Fix Everything, We Just Don't](https://erikmcclure.com/blog/we-could-fix-everything-we-just-dont/)*">}}

We have no excuses anymore. None of these are novel or difficult problems, not even the tragedy of the commons. We can do better. We don’t need AI to fix things. We don’t need new technology to solve these problems. We *already know how to do better*, we’ve just dug ourselves into a cooperation slump that’s so bad we can’t even implement solutions *we already know about*, let alone invent new ones. We’re in this hole simply because society is run by people who are incentiveized to sabotage cooperation in the name of profits. That’s it.

The hardest place to end this story, for me, has always been less about what to say and more about how to say it. I don't know if I'm hopeful, angry, frustrated, excited, inspired, or sad. It's a whole stew of emotions and so I feel as though I'm doing a disservice to you if I tell you - even implicitly - that you should be only one of those things. Though these pages I've told you how to feel. I've made light and dark sections, and tried to keep the vibe from swaying too much one way or the other.

But I think it's time I pull back the cover. I want to be honest about how I really feel about this, what emotion drove me to write all of this.

I.

From the crypto-bros to the social-media heads. From Musk, Zuck, Bankman-Fried, Jobs, and Bezos to Pichai and Nadella. Not one of them deserves our sypmathy. Their actions, and the actions of our congress-critters and leaders have put us into the situations we are in. They have co-opted democracies and made their fourtunes by selling information they rob from us without our consent. We have been sustaing casulties - and I don't mean this hyperbolically, I mean real lives, many of them teenagers, due to known social media malpractice. We have let these people put us against eachother because it feeds the almightly algorithm and engagement.

We are beyond the point of engaging polietly. We try to vote, they out spend us. We have politely knocked on every door.

<p style="font-size:3em">When one door closes,</p>

<p style="font-size:3em;text-align: right;">Smash open every window.<p>

We should stop playing their games. We should stop attributing everything to systemic problems when there is a handful of rich fucks not paying taxes that simultaniously try to control everything. We are beyond the point of voting being enough. The 2024 election goes to show, they're not above just buying the vote directly. But, how?

Hit them where it hurts: their pocket books.

Google is scared shitless of adblock. At the time of writing, they're finger has already pressed the nuklear <span style="display: inline-block;padding: 2px 24px;background-color: #e63946; /* Bright red color */color: white;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;font-size: 1.2em;font-weight: bold;

Meta (Facebook)? They profit off your data by selling to advertisers too. So don't just remove your data. Poison the well. Install [AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io) - it doesn't just block the ads, it fake clicks on every one. They won't know what you're interested in, and won't be able to call you a real user for selling you to advertisers. Then get your friends on it too.

But that's just adtech. What about uh, everything else?

My advice?
