# Lo' and Behold.

The technology we use every day isn't designed to be the best we can.

It's designed to make money.

It's not designed to be repaired.

It's designed to sell us "upgrades".

â€ˆ

The technology we use gives us unpresented ability to augment our minds with tools for thought.

We can access the bulk of human knowledge from a device in our pocket.

Hacker and maker communities have brought real change to the mainstream, and right to repair is making progress around the world!

There's a song - a story really - I like, by the Narcissist's Cookbook: *Cognitive Dissonance Blues*. It really captures this problem of being both wonderfully in awe of what we have made and simultaneously disgusted by it.

And there's this part in the song where he mentions one of my favorite stories about computers,

In 1969 Data was sent from a terminal at UCLA to a terminal at Stanford, hundreds of miles away

"lo". The first message was meant to be `LOGIN` but the system crashed, and so with some cosmic humor the defining technology of  the next chapter in human existence introduced itself and made its importance known.

Almost 30 years later, I entered this world. A few more after that,

I was hooked.

I went on to absorb technology - even going so far as to have an RFID tag implanted in each hand. I have lived and breathed technology, and yet, it saddens me to see the direction it goes in sometimes.

I want these wonderful inventions to inspire, to make lives better, but that's not the case though, is it?

Instead, it became a means to force-feed each of us our own personal advertising campaign

I feel like this is the sort of default with tech today, that everyone - regardless of technical skill, income, or amount of technology use - has become tired. Tired of technology designed for addiction and consumption rather than a healthy relationship with it.

Technology - computers - are unlike any other tool. While we may extend them with the ability to do physical actions (3D printers and the like), their primary utility is to augment our ability to think. To give us access to information and allow us to manipulate it. 

We've had tools like this before. Hell, the pen and paper or the printing press could be argued to be in the same lineage, but the sheer power of the computer - especially when networked to the World Wide Web. It's something else.

There are only so many ways you can make a "normal" tool bad. You might have a drill without enough torque. You might have a saw with a dull blade. You *can* make a tool bad by adding unnecessary things to it,<footnote>This is a [Leatherman ARC](https://www.leatherman.com/arc-702.html), which, ironically, I think is actually not bad at all. I actually carry a Leatherman Skeletool CX and think it's fantastic, but, you still get the point. </footnote>

The solution is easy: Don't buy that tool.

But computers?

You may not get the choice. The manufacturer, may decide to push an unwelcome "update" that spys on you. A function you rely on may be removed. New "features" which you do not care for and do not want in your way will be added.

Of course, new features you love will be added too. Software can get bug fixes. Entirely new kinds of software may come into existence.

You may meet new friends in a virtual world,

[TODO] VR Chat... maybe. I don't love this as an example.

I have written a series of posts similar to this one a few times, and each time I felt like I was missing something, but I finally figured it out: Agency.

Nobody likes reading a bunch of doom n' gloom and walking away from it feeling like there's nothing to do. So this time, I want to do it right.

Let's start from the ground up and talk about what's wrong with our computing landscape and what can actually be done to make it better.
