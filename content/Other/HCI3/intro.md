# Lo' and Behold.

The technology we use every day isn't designed to be the best we can.

It's designed to make money.

It's not designed to be repaired.

It's designed to sell us "upgrades".

{{< light >}}â€ˆ

The technology we use gives us unprecedented ability to augment our minds with tools for thought.

We can access the bulk of human knowledge from a device in our pocket.

Hacker and maker communities have brought real change to the mainstream, and right to repair is making progress around the world!

There's a song - a story really - I like, by the Narcissist's Cookbook: *Cognitive Dissonance Blues*. It really captures this problem of being both wonderfully in awe of what we have made and simultaneously disgusted by it.

And there's this part in the song where he mentions one of my favorite stories about computers,

In 1969 Data was sent from a terminal at UCLA to a terminal at Stanford, hundreds of miles away
And lo' [...]

"lo". The first message was meant to be `LOGIN` but the system crashed, and so with some cosmic humor the defining technology of  the next chapter in human existence introduced itself and made its importance known.

Almost 30 years later, I entered this world. A few more after that,

I was hooked.

I went on to absorb technology - even going so far as to have an RFID tag implanted in each hand. I have lived and breathed technology, and yet, it saddens me to see the direction it goes in sometimes.

I want these wonderful inventions to inspire, to make lives better, but that's not the case though, is it?

Instead, it became a means to force-feed each of us our own personal advertising campaign

I feel like this is the sort of default with tech today, that everyone - regardless of technical skill, income, or amount of technology use - has become tired. Tired of technology designed for addiction and consumption rather than a healthy relationship with it.

Technology - computers - are unlike any other tool. While we may extend them with the ability to do physical actions (3D printers and the like), their primary utility is to augment our ability to think. To give us access to information and allow us to manipulate it. 

We've had tools like this before. Hell, the pen and paper or the printing press could be argued to be in the same lineage, but the sheer power of the computer - especially when networked to the World Wide Web. It's something else.

There are only so many ways you can make a "normal" tool bad. You might have a drill without enough torque. You might have a saw with a dull blade. You *can* make a tool bad by adding unnecessary things to it,<footnote>This is a [Leatherman ARC](https://www.leatherman.com/arc-702.html), which, ironically, I think is actually not bad at all. I actually carry a Leatherman Skeletool CX and think it's fantastic, but, you still get the point. </footnote>

The solution is easy: Don't buy that tool.

But computers?

You may not get the choice. The manufacturer, may decide to push an unwelcome "update" that spys on you. A function you rely on may be removed. New "features" which you do not care for and do not want in your way will be added. Additionally, you don't have choice to not use computers. If you want to pay your bills, renew your license, apply for jobs, or generally exist as an adult you're using a computer.

{{< light >}}

Of course, new features you love will be added too. Software can get bug fixes. Entirely new kinds of software may come into existence.

You may meet new friends in a virtual world,

[TODO] VR Chat... maybe. I don't love this as an example.

These conflicting views are nothing new. Solarpunk and Cyberpunk SciFi stories have long shown technology as either utopian or dystopian, but I think some people miss the point. In most of these visions of our technological future it's not just weather or not the government is oppressive or if we're using green energy to power our tools, it's about what a tool even is.

Take the Cyberpunk 2077 series - at this point, "the" image that is conjured in most people's heads when they think of the style,


One of the key elements in this vision (and many other) cyberpunk world is computerized body modifications which grant the user some sort of super human ability. Often these come with obvious marks of how they've been implanted and side effects that are deemed acceptable sacrifices to the user.

In these visions, technology isn't seen as symbiotic to the human experience, but as a superior replacement of it. It doesn't need to adapt well to people, because it is inherently above humanity's natural state.

{{< light >}}

Contrast this with the vision of most solarpunk stories and art. Again, the most surface level difference is that, typically, the world is painted in a less dark, dystopian light and more in a positive happy tone. This, itself explains it being less common in media: Stories exist to tell about conflict and overcoming adversity. It's easier to do that in a world which is built on it. Looking more deeply you can see that technology in these stories, if augmenting the human experience, is doing so to assist, not replace.

Similarly, in most Solarpunk media there are strong communities and the technology employed by them serves the entire community, rarely the individual. Think community gardens with community maintained soil and water monitoring, shared communications infrastructure, public transit systems, etc.

This leads into an important point: Many technology problems aren't technology problems.</br>**They're policy problems.**

As with all things in life money, politics, crime, and power play a big role in our technology landscape. There is a financial incentive for closed systems and walled gardens. Criminals will seek to use computers to hurt others to make money, be it though traditional hacking and scams or by taking advantage of looser regulations on cryptocurrency and running pump-and-dump schemes. Ad tech is a trillion dollar industry that is only worth as much as it is because of the immense amounts of data they can collect because they lobby governments hard enough to not put in reasonable protections. Meanwhile, copyright law has been twisted to the point it is used to prevent you from being able to legally modify things you own because you might be a dirty criminal that wants to take a sceenshot of a movie to make a meme.<footnote>I've wrapped a lot into that last sentence that might not make sense if you're not coming into this with any prior background.</br></br>These may sound unrelated (modifying hardware and taking a screenshot) but both stem from a law (The DMCA) created in the US and adopted by most other countries which makes it a crime to circumvent copyright protection software or hardware.</br></br>This impacts your ability to control even basic devices you own because pretty much everything has a computer in it now. Say your car has a subscription fee to use the heated seats (Yes, this is a thing), well that's software. If you bypass this with a software tool to "unlock" the feature, that's a crime, even if you own the car.</br></br>Similarly, your computer's graphics hardware has special instructions which mean if you're playing a movie from Netflix and you go to take a screenshot, it will actually not be able to see that image and the screenshot will just be black. This is a mix of a software and hardware copyright scheme, but both are covered by the DMCA. And, again, bypassing this would be a crime.</br></br>Using that screenshot of the movie for, say, a review of the movie would absolutely be legal and covered under fair use, but acquiring that screenshot by bypassing that system is a crime.</footnote>

Because of this, these pages will not be a-political. Trans and black lives matter, I will not be ruled by an psychotic orange king, and I want to own my fucking technology and be able to run whatever software I god damn please on it.

I have written a series of posts similar to this one a few times, and each time I felt like I was missing something, but I finally figured it out: Agency.

Nobody likes reading a bunch of doom n' gloom and walking away from it feeling like there's nothing to do. So this time, I want to do it right.

Let's start from the ground up and talk about what's wrong with our computing landscape and what can actually be done to make it better.
