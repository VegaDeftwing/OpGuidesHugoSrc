# Art While Computing

In a world where sleek minimalism reigns supreme, something essential is missing from our digital and physical spaces. The flat design language — characterized by its **sterile**, **gray** tones and **function-over-form** approach — has quietly eroded one of the most human aspects of technology: our emotional connection to it.

Too often, our interactions with screens and devices are utilitarian, devoid of personality or artistry. And as our workspaces — both digital and physical — become increasingly bland, the impact on our mental health is subtle but real.

Can you tell that was complete and total AI bullshit?

I don't know about you, but that exact overly sterile, built for corprate consumption flavor of text is what makes me hate the art - or lack of it - in most computing setups.

Computers are a different kind of tool because they augment our ability to think - letting us do more to categorize and work with our thoughts than any tool before.

But, while computers augment *how* we think, - and yes I know how cheesy this is about to sound - art augments *what* we think.

You can't change everything you see. Ultimately, you don't have total control of your environment. You can choose what enivorments you're in though - vote with your wallet and go to restraunts with murals painted by local artists, etc. - and you should have at least one you control.

(If you don't, raise hell until you do.)

So what do you do with your computing environment? Do you own it? Do you decide how it makes you feel?

How does **THIS** - This font, The above art - make you feel?

</div>

My hope isn't any one emotion - it's the presence of *some* emotion. Something other than the resting, default state of indiference that gray cubicle walls give.

I'm not going to pretend that minimalism doesn't serve a purpose. I know **this font** is much easier to read. But it's about having a balanced diet, and as is I think everyone is just eating Soylent.

## Focus ≠ Minimalism

For *some* people, having a work environment that is a white void with a monitor, keyboard, and chair is the ideal.

I think sort of minimal, ultra-clean aesthic is an overly pervasive, bad ideal *for most people* though, and a lot of people chase it without questioning what's actually best for them.

## Finding your vibe

You **can** make an environment that works for you. But, you need to know what you prefer.

I think this comes down to a few factors:

**Accessability**: If you put something away, will you still use it?

Do you need it to be already setup, connected, ready to use?</br>
Is it okay if it's put away, but still in sight?</br>
Would you rather have focus by not having anything but the tool in use infront of you?

**Stimulus**: If you have something moving around you, flashing, making noise will it bother you?

Do you need some background stimulus, like music or slowly shifting lighting?

**Vibe**: Does your environment put you in the right mood? 

This doesn't mean relaxed, necessarily. You might be working on something where being high energy or creative is more important than slow and methodical. Your environment might also need to be capable of supporting multiple moods.

You also may want it to intentionally help you get into a mood other than your default-state. Maybe you want it to make you feel inspired to take risks and create or maybe you want it to inspire you to slow down, enjoy a cup of hot chocolate and read a book.

How do you get those right? Eh, mostly experimentation - but there's a few easy things you can try:

**Change the lighting:** Having more light, espcially, can be a huge a mood lifter. The color temperature and how diffused it is matters a lot too.

**Don't worry about a cohesive vibe:** Trying to look profesional, or punk, or futuristic, or minimal. It doesn't make for a fun space. Still thing about organization, but don't worry about the details. Do what makes you happy, and the vibe will be YOU. For your space, that's what matters.

**Don't be embarrassed by your passion:** Are you into rocks? Make a UV mineral display case! Collect guitars? Hang em' up. Make art? Display it.

## Custom art

Being a furry<footnote>OwO</footnote>, I often hang out with artists. Wanna know a secret?

Most of them don't charge as much as you think.

<img src="/nonfree/character/sign_transp-1.webp" alt=" " class="lg-no-shadow" style="height:10em;float:left;margin-right: 1em;">

The only "expensive" piece I have was $350 but is this ~4sq feet stop sign and was hand painted by someone that makes art for a living, and even at that price I'm not really convinced they made a fair hourly rate.

<div class="clr"></div>

Digital art generally isn't anywhere near that much. Want custom art of your two favorite characters from two different movies kissing? Commission that shit. Most digital art commissions I've paid for were under $30.

## ...And custom Art can be anything

You don't have to get 2D art as custom art. One of my friends often gets custom made stuffed animals that look absolutely stunning,

All of this applies to your digital space as well. Custom desktop wallpapers, theme packs, or even tweaking CSS in the software you use daily can inject that same personal spark. The smallest changes — like setting your color scheme in in your text editor to something a bit more vibrant or customizing your browser's homepage make a big difference. Of course, when we get to the digital sections we'll talk about just how far this can go - though there the focus will be on utility. So, going forward, don't forget about beauty.
