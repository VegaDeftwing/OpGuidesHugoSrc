# The Way We Interact With Computers Sucks.

<script>    document.getElementById("hciMenu").open = true;</script>

**What do you see when you sit down to work?** My guess is a desk pressed against a wall, maybe a few shelves, one, maybe two monitors in front of you, and a keyboard and mouse dominating the work area of your desk. How do you access information? Do you simply Google something and if it's not on the first page give up? How do you get reliable information when you have a question? How do you interpret results that you find? How do you store information you've collected? How do you filter information to get exactly what you're looking for?

If you're reading this, I'd wager that you've at least thought about this a little. Maybe you're a Linux user, deep into the tiling window manager rabbit hole. Maybe you already have a fancy keyboard, monitors surrounding you on all sides. But I'm here to tell you that no matter how hard you've tried, **what you're using still probably sucks**.

I think we, as individuals and as business, need to invest more in our work spaces, probably well beyond what most people would even consider. I'm not talking about adding a third monitor or giving everyone an artistic environment. I'm talking about setting up a work environment that's conducive to productivity as instead of merely being the medium on which it takes place, the work environment should actively contribute to finding, accessing, retrieving/storing, consuming, and creating. - where data can be anything: art, documentation, code, whatever.

## HCI?

**Human Computer Interaction** or [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) is an interesting topic to me. So many people spend a crazy amount of time in front of a screen , you'd think we'd have some *damn* good hardware and software to use while we further deepen the permanent butt-shaped indentation into our seats, but alas, instead most people use *ˢʰᵘᵈᵈᵉʳ* Windows.

Back in late 2018 I wrote the first version of this post and basically everything in there has been restated here but better. Since then I've talked to many others about this, read *many* other blog posts, and just generally done a lot of new things with computers and learned a lot, so here's HCI2: Electric Boogaloo.
