# Wrapping up

In all honestly I'm not exactly sure what everything I just wrote is about. Mostly it's just a lot of ranting, but hopefully it has been interesting. To round things off with a bit of a closing note though, I don't actually foresee many of the things I mentioned becoming common place or many even being possible, if not simply because they're require so many people to agree on [standards](https://xkcd.com/927/), but there is one glimmer of hope, and it's one of proof of uniformity. The terminal. Yes. This terminal:

![terminal](/eng/proc.webp)

The terminal emulator above is still compatible with the VT220 from 1983 (as are most terminal emulators) yet from it, with a good shell (like ZSH) I can do everything I can really think of: [browse the web](https://askubuntu.com/questions/29540/browsing-the-internet-from-the-command-line), [chat with friends](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/10/use-telegram-cli-in-terminal-ubuntu),[ listen to music](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ncmpcpp), [basically anything](http://www.tuxarena.com/2014/03/20-great-terminal-replacements-for-gui-applications/). I'm not saying we should all stop using chrome, but I think part of the reason so many neck beards and sysadmins still use the terminal is you can do so much with it, everything that uses it as a common interface, and it has programming capabilities. You can automate or string together just about anything, exactly as I described above. 

Finally, I'd like to say I understand we don't all get the choice, be it by monetary, physical, or other restrictions, to have a 'perfect' work environment. If you live in the city there will be noise, If you live in the country, you may be limited by your internet connection, I get that. Obviously I don't expect everyone to go out and make their own versions of some of the high tech, borderline art installations that I linked either. I also don't think everyone's down to go get an RFID tag in their hand. I just wanted to present what I see as 'the future'. It probably won't come in 2021 or even 20021. I do, however, hope this has inspired you to look at the way you work, the environment you work in, and how you can improve it.
