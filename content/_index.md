# Welcome to Opinionated Guides

The biggest section of this site is [Opinionated Engineering]({{< relref "/Engineering/community" >}}),
but that isn't to say [Opinionated Music]({{< relref "Music/m1-gettingstarted" >}}), [Opinionated Design]({{< relref "Design/d1-basics" >}}), and [Opinionated Philosophy]({{< relref "Phil/p1-basic" >}}) aren't worth checking out too.

You'll also find some other miscalculation stuff, such as [Interviews]({{< relref "Interviews/interviews" >}}), and [blog posts]({{< relref "posts" >}}).

The site is *mostly* maintained by me, Vega ‚Üì

But I more than welcome contributions. Either submit a pull request or, if you're dedicated to helping a lot, I can add you as a contributor if you get in touch with me (find me most places as Vega Deftwing).

**Alright, but who are you?**

I'm Vega, a Computer and Electrical Engineering student and I'm very into music, especially guitars and eurorack. I enjoy spending my free time scouring the internet for new things to learn and falling down YouTube pits until 3 in the morning. I'm that guy that types on a split Dvorak keyboard, and that wears an old vacuum tube around my neck, but I also like long boarding around town and playing video games.

{{< /columns >}}

I'm pretty opinionated, but I'd like to think most of those opinions have been tested reasonably rigorously or have at the very least come from a fair amount of experience, though I know I will need to update this site based on new information over time. I will occasionally try to sway you into my camp - like getting you to use Linux - for reasons that are both practical and ideological; however, I hope that once I share my reasons for both you'll agree as well. Of course, I greatly enjoy a good debate and hearing new information too, so if you disagree, to me that's even more valuable.

**TLDR**: I enjoy programming guitars and playing computers üíæ I strum Dvorak, and type in chords ü§ò

# Why?

Why write Opinionated Guides?

Honestly, the answer changes from time to time.

At first, I had this grandiose idea that I could offer something akin to a college education for Comp Sci, Comp Eng, and Electrical Engineering.

And maybe that's possible still, maybe over the course of a decade OpGuides will still end up as that. But I don't think that's even what I want anymore. I don't want this to be Vega's Opinionated Big Ass Book To Give You An All-In-One Education, both because VegaOpBABTGYAAIOEdu is far less catchy, and because I don't even think it's possible. The more I write on this the more I value input of others and other resources I find, and the more happy I am that I called this project Opinionated Guides.

*A Guide*. That's what I want this to be. I want OpGuides to be a resource that's like your friend you can come back to for advice on where to go next, and I think that's something the internet really needs. Search engines ~~are~~ were awesome for finding information, but only when you know what to look for, so I figure OpGuides can be a sort of curated information source, with the crappy results filtered out, the best resources I know of included, and a healthy mix of entertainment in the education so that it's not a chore to read.

But that's what I want, not the why. Why am I doing it? I'm deeply passionate about what I write about and I really, really just want to share my passions with others. The idea that much of the information for the topics I care about is either:

* Being behind the ever growing pay wall of college education

* Being presented in the most horribly dry to read text books

* Or being glossed over as people get a poor excuse of an engineering (or other technical) education that misses out on so much of both the really important stuff and the really, really fucking cool stuff 

is crazy to me. Like somehow what we have right now is expensive, boring, low quality, and isn't even worth it.

Seriously, look at how poor of a value even a technical education is becoming as college prices sky rocket, the dream of a graduate with work-life balance is imploding, and the big employers of computer engineers and computer scientists being generally fucking evil and I just don't get why anyone* would do it.

*except for 18y/o high school graduates that have been fed the line that college is necessary for them to have a fulfilling life and that their parents expect it from them

I fell down that trap. College isn't worth it. But maybe I can use that education to give anyone who finds these guides a better one. Because of my college experience I do know what college gets right and wrong, what is covered and isn't. And, while I think I could have done a lot better on my own, it did serve as the catalyst. It gave me the terms to search, it pulled the curtain back just enough so that I could see some of the options. I hope that OpGuides can supplement your college education, that I can finish the job of opening the curtains to give you the full stage, to show you the things you missed or re-light that spark of passion for the same things that I'm passionate about yet college managed to turn into a dull delve into cryptic and dead yet far too expensive text books.

OpGuides won't ever be a single resource and should never be in print. The reason I know I can do better is because instead of shying away from the internet and other resources for the sake of selling a book, I want to show them off and link to them. That's why I think I stand a chance of making something that can compete with college: I'm not alone, I'm a guide, showing you around the internet and introducing your to my other ~~totally not para-social relationships~~ friends.

And an additional **thank you** from the bottom of my heart to **Loial Otter**, **Soatok Dreamseeker**, and **Cadey Ratio** for the opportunity to do an interview with each, as well as to all my friends that have read over the guides and helped point out issues and gaps in content, and finally to all those that haven't just responded with 'RTFM' and worked with me as I've asked some of absolute legends in their fileds to help with the OpGuides project. ‚ù§Ô∏è

At the same time, some images and most of the text on OpGuides is the original work of either myself or other contributors. For the text, I don't really care, but for the images, gifs, etc. I do retain my copyright; however, you -the reader- are totally free to use it as long as it is **NOT** used...

  * Of course you still have fair use rights for criticism and review, but you know how those limits apply.
  * Don't be a dick.
* in a commercial text-book without asking permission
  * If you're from [Pearson](https://twitter.com/Vega_DW/status/1165017179865133059) or McGraw Hill the answer is no

  * If you're a professor or educator, please link to me, but I swear to god if you try to make students pay for an even 1 credit hour class and just say 'Oh, here, read this' I will be livid enough to seek legal action.

If you repost content from OpGuides instead of linking to it directly it'd be very uncool of you to not at least credit the OpGuides project with a link.
