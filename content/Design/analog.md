# Analog Art

## What makes it 'analog'

For OpGuides I'm going to refer to any non-digital art as analog. Traditionally, this art {{< vale >}}is called{{< /vale >}} traditional. I don't like this term as it implies that there's a right 'traditional' way to do things, and that's a load of shit. Whenever I say analog, don't think about it too much. I just mean not using software and a computer, or, if using a computer, it's not necessary for the majority of the effort that's used to make the end product. For example, 3D printing a model to then paint it.

## Glass

While I haven't done this personally, based on the sheer amount of content on YouTube and hearing others experience making stained-glass isn't nearly as hard as one would assume

Of course, that's assuming you have the glass already. From what I've seen, making from-scratch, hand-blowing, or re-flowing glass trinkets is exceptionally difficult.

I'm not saying any of this to dissuade you from trying anything, just stating where you may want to start.
