## Photography

https://filmulator.org/about/ 

> Filmulator accepts raw files from cameras and simulates the development of film as if exposed to the same light as the camera's sensor. This brings about several benefits:
>
> - Large bright regions become darker, compressing the output dynamic range.
> - Small bright regions make their surroundings darker, enhancing local contrast.
> - In bright regions, saturation is enhanced, helping retain color in bright skies, brighter skin tones, and sunsets.
> - In extremely saturated regions, the brightness is attenuated, helping retain detail e.g. in flowers.
