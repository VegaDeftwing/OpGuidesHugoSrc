# The Basics of Art and Design

When you're first learning art, every art class will beat a few core ideas into your head: 

* **Lines** - The 'structure' bits of the works, when you start making art, you'll often start with the Line Art

* **Shape** - Structures that form out of lines, might appear 3D. These might be mathy, like squares, or organic, like an eye

* **Form** - Mostly applicable to 3D (or art interpreted as 3D) - Think of this as the shape you'd see if you could move around the object in real life 

* **Color** - Color's consist of hue (red, blue, etc.), saturation (how 'strong' the color is), and value (how bright/dark the color is)

* **Space** - The relationship between objects, including the empty space between them (Negative space)

* **Texture** - Is it smooth? Reflective? Rough? Does it look painted or flatly colored?

* **Value** - How dark or light is each region

These are your fundamental building blocks of art, and you should get to know them. Rather than try to poorly teach these to you, I'm going to recommend you check out this [Art Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVgLT-e3jXPDgeED0pD0BPq8kY1VAZAGa) playlist from Swatches on YouTube.

Things like digi shoes, tail holes in clothing, tail bags, etc. really help make characters feel like they're part of an actual world.
