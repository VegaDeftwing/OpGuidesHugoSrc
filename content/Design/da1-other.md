## Engines & Frameworks

### Both 2d and 3d

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/features)

[Luxe](https://luxeengine.com)

*fine. I'll mention Unity and Unreal, but, like, I hate that the two make up such a huge chunk of the market*

[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/)

[Unity](https://unity.com)

### 2d

[LEd engine](https://deepnight.itch.io/led) - "LEd is a modern and open-source 2D level editor, specifically designed for indie devs"

[OGMO Editor](https://ogmoeditor.itch.io/editor) - "OGMO Editor is a free, open source 2D level editor built by indie game developers for indie game developers."

[LOÌˆVE](https://love2d.org) - "Hi there! LÃ–VE is an *awesome* framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua. It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS."

[Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) - **Pyxel** is a retro game engine for Python.

### 3d

[pwnfps engine](https://fanzyflani.itch.io/pwnfps-engine) - "An incomplete game engine I made for 7DFPS 2014 using C and a bit of Lua. It's a realtime raytracer that happens to be pretty shiny."

[noeuclid by CNLohr](https://github.com/cnlohr/noeuclid) - A Non-euclidean GPU Raytraced Engine

[euclider](https://github.com/Limeth/euclider) - A higher-dimensional "non-euclidean" ray tracing prototype written in Rust.

[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-3/) - "A refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust
Free and Open Source Forever!"

{{< hint info >}}

'Non Euclidean' is a super mathy term and I'm really into it, basically it just means that space doesn't quite work as you expect. The shortest distance between two points doesn't have to be a line, portals connecting spaces, walking in circles takes you new places, etc. [Here's a decent blog post about some](https://zenorogue.medium.com/non-euclidean-geometry-and-games-fb46989320d4).

{{< hint warning >}}

Heads up, not all 3d systems use the same coordinate systems. It's a bit of a pain. Here's a good chart for that ([source - @FreyaHolmer on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer/status/1325556229410861056/photo/1))

A very long thread on ... stairs? Yeah. Look up advice on DND level design if you need general level design or architecture design n advice. The same twitter (Tommy Norberg, @the_Norberg) has **many** other good posts

### Tons of Simulation

[Notia](https://noitagame.com) - Rougelite where every pixel is simulated

[Cogmind](https://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/) - Ascii art game with a similarly extreme amount of environment destructibility

## Photography

https://filmulator.org/about/ 

> Filmulator accepts raw files from cameras and simulates the development of film as if exposed to the same light as the camera's sensor. This brings about several benefits:
>
> - Large bright regions become darker, compressing the output dynamic range.
> - Small bright regions make their surroundings darker, enhancing local contrast.
> - In bright regions, saturation is enhanced, helping retain color in bright skies, brighter skin tones, and sunsets.
> - In extremely saturated regions, the brightness is attenuated, helping retain detail e.g. in flowers.
