# Setting up everything you need to make a website

[TODO] - include instructions for Github pages, a VPS, and self hosted *but* assume a Hugo site for all three. There's gotta be limits in the complexity somewhere, and I draw the line at setting up everything for decent JS web app dev / PHP shit, cloud/AWS, etc. though I still want to link to external resources for those things. Also, this probably needs to be written for win/mac/lin, which means there will have to be a ton of permutations of getting things setup depending on hosting solution and OS.
