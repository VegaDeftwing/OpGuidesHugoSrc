I've interviewed a few people for OpGuides now, and I got to thinking, "How would I respond to these questions?" so, I'll interview myself!

# An Interview With Myself

**7/26/2021**

**Hi me, to get started, can you describe yourself?**

Ah, shit. Nobody likes this question. My tag line on most social media is "programming guitars and playing computrers", that is, I like to find the nerdy esoteric bits in things. I like to make music, but when I do I go about it with a lot more sound design than anything else, and with most of the modular stuff I do, I think it feels a bit like programming. Similarly, with computers I like to tinker and play around, not just use them as a simple utility. I joke that I went to college so that I could "walk up to anything with wires, slap it, and make it work". Since I have RFID tags in my hands, I think I'm getting there.

But that's still *what I do* not *who I am*. I'm someone that sometimes fails to value having fun and doing things for the experiance, instead prioritizing creating and experimenting, sometimes getting stuck in ruts. I'm a failible person struggling though the same problems as everyone else: I'm trying to find ways to stay motivated to stay in shape, I drink too much soda, I easily get addicted to Minecraft, and sometimes I find it hard to get excited about anything. I'm not depressed, or overly happy, I'm just *me*.

You can easily enough slap a few labels on me: Socialist, Furry, Musician, Programmer, Student, Artist, Gamer, Bisexual. I just don't really see myself as any single thing like that. I have a diverse enough list of hobbies and views that I'm not your sterotypical guy from any of these groups.

I think to me, the biggest things I value are **passion** and **courage**. I value passion, in myself or others, to explore a topic to great depths. If I'm talking to you and you're smiling to me while rapidly explaining something that like 0.001% of the population even knows exists, I think that's fucking awesome. Similarly, I value courage: the courage to be the guy that asks questions in class, the courage to call out a racist family member.

**You mix the furry fandom into a lot that you do, why?**

Humans are boring. Our names are boring. Our entire society is boring (and depressing). It's a bit of a mix of escapism and a desire to add some flair into things. Animals faces and designs can express a lot more than human faces, and their skin tones don't carry baggage.

**If you could go back and redesign any part of how the internet works, what would you change?**

Distributed everything. I visit a website, then it's stored on my system for a while and my neighbor can get it from me, that sorta thing.

**Do you think society has been negatively or positively impacted by the way the Internet and social media has changed how people interact?**

Yes.

**Is there any skill you wish you had developed in a formal education that you didn't?**

Music theory and reading music. Teaching myself has proven extraordinarly difficult.

**When doing ___ stuff, what does your work environment look like?**

Becauese I'm a bit insane, my setup is made so that this one desktop does *EVERYTHING*. Music. Art. Programming. Electronics design. Gaming.

My main tower has good specs (R3900x, 32GB, Vega56), but it's the peripherals were it shines. I've got enough devices hooked into this thing that I bet I have a few miles of cable coming out the back. 3 4k monitors? Check. 18 input, 20 output audio interface? Check. Guitar pedal board. Yep. Graphics tablet? On my right. Gaming mouse? You bet. Midi controllers? More than reasonable. Hell, I've got two mechanical keyboards on this thing.

[TODO] picture here

**Is there any skill that you spent too much time developing that you wish you hadn't?**

Does being good at Minecraft count? For an actual skill: typing on Dvorak. While it does have it's upsides and did help me avoid RSI, I wish I could have just learned QWERTY correctly. I learend Dvorak because I found it much easier to learn something new than re-train myself to do something I already did incorectly. Long term, it sorta sucks to be slow on other people's competers though.

**What's the most important skill that you've taught yourself?**

Linux CLI usage and programming. Between the tow I feel like I can actually use a competer to do things that it was meant to do. Once I got even slightly comptent with it, it felt like I'd been trying to use the claw side of a hammer to drive nails in my entire life - I felt dumb for not learning the right way sooner.

**What do you do for fun? Any books, movies, TV shows, etc. that you'd recommend?**

I really suck at letting myself have fun. I like to play video games and wach anime, usually the really cheesy, aimed at teenagers Isekai anime - just not SAO. I do have taste. Out of choice paralysis and falling into "If I just watch this one YouTube video it's not so bad" I end up watching an unhealthy amount of YouTube instead of actually recharging by doing things that I really enjoy. Quality > Quantity, but I suck at taking my own advice.

As for what I reccomend: Whatever you can walk away from and not feel like you just marathoned it unhealithy. If you're not excited enough to want to share it with others, it's probably not good enough to keep watching. Don't fall into a sunk cost falacy on your entertainment- that's the mindset that leads to watching all 15 seasons of Supernatural. Trust me. I know.

But okay, a few real recomendations: BVM, Future Football, Wait But Why: The Sick Giant, Snowden

**What's the biggest 'Oh Shit' moment you've ever had, be it one you caught in time or not?**

Putting 10kv up my arm when wood burning was certainly a good one. Feels a lot like having a leg "fall asleep" but like 10x stronger and more painful.

**Who are your biggest inspirations? What creators do you think are way to underrated and deserve a shout out?**

[TODO] Soatok, Loial, Cadey, Noise Engineering, 3B1B, Emily Hopkins, ARP, Jan Misli, Wolfgun, The Thought Emporium, BVM, Future Football, 

**What's the best advice you've ever received? Worst?**

For a few select things you care about: put one minute in, every day. No matter how much you don't want to do it, give it 60 seconds. If you still don't want to do it, stop. The hardest part of working out is convincing yourself to do it, so just start. You'll usually end up finishing.

**How do you stay motivated to keep doing cool things?**

Copious amounts of caffine, existential dread, and far to high expectations for myself.

**What hobby do you want to get into but haven't had a chance to dive into yet?**

I've divied into most everything I'm interested in, just to varrying levels of sucesss. Archery was fun, but 100% did not agree with my body. 3D modeling is cool, but I'm shit at art in general- I'm fine if I have lines and refrence, but I really stuggle with getting the line art or mock up done in 2D or 3D respectively.

I would like to get into glass blowing, metal casting, making DIY amps, binary exploitation, video sythesis, speed running, and cooking, but each of those have been blocked by money, money, money, time, money, time, and laziness respectively.
