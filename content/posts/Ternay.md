This paper was written for CSCE-430, Computer Architecture at University Of Nebraska - Lincoln in Spring of 2021.

This in-page view isn't all that great, so feel free to [download the pdf directly](https://opguides.info/nonfree/blog/ternary.pdf).

If you would like to read the refrenced papers, I reccomend using [Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) with a VPN on, as the academic publishers putting up paywalls as barriers to science can go fuck themselves.
