{{< tip >}}

Before anything else, I think it's necessary to point out this is **opinionated** guides. Philosophy involves looking at the world around us and asking ourselves 'why', then making arguments for how things should be different and what moral frameworks work best to come to conclusions that optimize for something like happiness or 'goodness' in the world. Given that both morals and 'goodness' are not absolutes, the best way for me to write this guide and actually be of service to you as a reader is to provide my **opinion** and talk about why I believe what believe both from a researched 'here are the facts' sense and from a 'here is the moral framework that, with these facts, brought me to this conclusion' sense. You don't have to agree with my opinions, I'd rather you didn't actually, as agreement means talking to you doesn't expose me to new ideas.<a class="ptr">(1)</a> Instead it's my hope that reading my opinion, seeing how I present arguments, and seeing the research that goes into them will show you how to think about how to apply facts to moral frameworks.

I also want to toss up a **content warning**, for, like, everything. We're gonna get messy. This means assisted suicide, abortion, religion, gun rights, war, labor rights, etc. Just look at the chapters on the left and it reads as a shopping list of topics not to bring up at a family gathering.

# Basic Philosophy

First, let's start really simple- what **is** philosophy. Well, for one, [Basically all pages on Wikipedia link back to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy), so it's obviously pretty fundamental. But, why would that be?

Here's the head of the Wikipedia entry on Philosophy:

> **Philosophy** (from Greek: φιλοσοφία, *philosophia*, 'love of wisdom') is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language

Alright, so it's the study of knowledge? wouldn't that make it pretty much the study of everything? Well, yeah. Pretty much. Before each branch of the sciencies had enough of a foundation in it's own right to, well, branch off it was just called 'Philosophy'.

This pretty much means that today Philosophy is what's left- the questions for which there are no concrete or provable answers. This can often be incredibly frustrating. But, what Philosophy as a modern study really gives us is a framework to approach and talk about these tough problems. In general this gives the three big branches of philosophy today. Natural, Metaphysical, and Moral Philosophy. Honestly, I find the first two mostly consist of people trying to look smart and are mostly not applicable to anyone, unless you're really into debating the existance of (a) God(s). <a class="ptr">(2)</a><a class="ptr">(3)</a>

	<li>To be transparent and tell you my biases up front, I'm WEIRD, that is I'm from a Western, Eduated, Industrialized, Rich, & Democratic Country- The US. I'm also white, bisexual, liberal with a tinge of libertarian, and Gen Z.</li>
    <li>Yes, I know I'm throwing shade here. This isn't to say Metaphysical and Natural Philosophy are useless. I really enjoy watching videos on YouTube of people pointing out the many, many logical issues that aries when you try to make a Omnipotent (all-powerfull), Onmiscincent (all-knowing), Onmi-present (in all places), Omnibenevolent (all good) being. My favorite argument being the 'If God is all knowing does he know what it's like to feel lust, if he does how is he all good?' or 'If god is all powerful can he microwave a burrito so hot that he can not eat it?' ... you get the idea. This is turning into a massive tangent. Here, have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNQkSJXUzjo">link (The Problem of Omnipotence - YouTube)</a></li>
<li> Okay, I also have to concede, there's a lot of really thought provoking stuff in the relm of metaphysics. I espically love  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Exurb1a/videos"> Exurb1a's YouTube Channel</a> as well as a lot of video games, short stories, and other works that dabble in this. For example, I recently read <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/">17776 Football</a>, and I keep thinking about it. That's what makes metaphysics cool. It keeps you thinking and can inspire you in interesting ways - espically for being creative with writing, art, or music. I just don't see direct value in going in to it in this guide. Please do actually check out some of the amazing content on the subject though!</li>
</ol>

Alright, so, let's stick to (mostly) moral philosophy (often just called Ethics) then. What does that entail?



## Utilitarianism

## Consequentialism

## Kantianism

## Moral Relativism

Trolley Problem, common arguments
