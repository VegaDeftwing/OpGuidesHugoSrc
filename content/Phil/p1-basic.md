# Basic Philosophy

First, let's start really simple- what **is** philosophy. Well, for one, [Basically all pages on Wikipedia link back to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy), so it's obviously pretty fundamental. But, why would that be?

Here's the head of the Wikipedia entry on Philosophy:

> **Philosophy** (from Greek: φιλοσοφία, *philosophia*, 'love of wisdom') is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language

Alright, so it's the study of knowledge? wouldn't that make it pretty much the study of everything? Well, yeah. Pretty much. Before each branch of the sciencies had enough of a foundation in it's own right to, well, branch off it was just called 'Philosophy'.

This pretty much means that today Philosophy is what's left- the questions for which there are no concrete or provable answers. This can often be incredibly frustrating. But, what Philosophy as a modern study really gives us is a framework to approach and talk about these tough problems. In general this gives the three big branches of philosophy today. Natural, Metaphysical, and Moral Philosophy. Honestly, I find the first two mostly consist of people trying to look smart and are mostly not applicable to anyone, unless you're really into debating the existance of (a) God(s). <a class="ptr">(1)</a><a class="ptr">(2)</a>

    <li>Yes, I know I'm throwing shade here. This isn't to say Metaphysical and Natural Philosophy are useless. I really enjoy watching videos on YouTube of people pointing out the many, many logical issues that aries when you try to make a Omnipotent (all-powerfull), Onmiscincent (all-knowing), Onmi-present (in all places), Omnibenevolent (all good) being. My favorite argument being the 'If God is all knowing does he know what it's like to feel lust, if he does how is he all good?' or 'If god is all powerful can he microwave a burrito so hot that he can not eat it?' ... you get the idea. This is turning into a massive tangent. Here, have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNQkSJXUzjo">link (The Problem of Omnipotence - YouTube)</a></li>
<li> Okay, I also have to concede, there's a lot of really thought provoking stuff in the relm of metaphysics. I espically love  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Exurb1a/videos"> Exurb1a's YouTube Channel</a> as well as a lot of video games, short stories, and other works that dabble in this. For example, I recently read <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/">17776 Football</a>, and I keep thinking about it. That's what makes metaphysics cool. It keeps you thinking and can inspire you in interesting ways - espically for being creative with writing, art, or music. I just don't see direct value in going in to it in this guide. Please do actually check out some of the amazing content on the subject though!</li>

Alright, so, let's stick to (mostly) moral philosophy (often just called Ethics) then. What does that entail?



## Utilitarianism

## Consequentialism

## Kantianism

## Moral Relativism
