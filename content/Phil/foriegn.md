This embedable version of this video is a re-upload. The orginal, from 'Second Thought' on YouTube is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2khAmMTAjI) but has been age restricted and has been shadow-banned by YouTube. The entire situation just proves the point, here's the video creators twitter thread on the issue (click to see the entire thread)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is going to be an important thread. We need to talk about YouTube, and private media operations in general<br><br>This thread was prompted by YouTube’s shadow ban of my new video, but that’s really just a minor inconvenience. The whole story involves YouTube, the DHS, and the CIA</p>&mdash; JT Chapman (@_SecondThought) <a href="https://twitter.com/_SecondThought/status/1332746158947635202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But to me, the stand out tweet is this one:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That video earned me a visit from the DHS, who asked me about &quot;Anti-American sentiment&quot; in my videos. That was the first time I realized, wow, I guess people really are monitoring what we say and are willing to try to intimidate us, even if what we say is objectively true.</p>&mdash; JT Chapman (@_SecondThought) <a href="https://twitter.com/_SecondThought/status/1332746172570677250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
