# Elections & Voting

{{< tip >}}

I'm a 'murican, so this will be US centric, that said, the arguments here could likely be applied universally

{{< /tip >}}

## Issue 1: FPTP Voting Sucks



lower standards of removal, ranked, transparency
Budget voting

## Issue 2: Voters are really, really stupid

voting based on if they like the person, how he/she looks, single issue voting

## Issue 3: Two is the unfriendliest number



## Issue 4: Gerrymandering and Fraud

## Online Voting

> **Having just gone though the 2020 election, with what seem to be mass unfounded allegations of voter fraud, do you think electronic voting, potentially over the internet, should have been used?**
>
> No.
>
> What's the failure mode for a hacked election? You can't just *roll back* a political career advancement.
>
> The threat model for elections is incompatible with the BYOB mental model of consumer electronics (which is what people imply when they talk about electronic voting).
>
> Paper ballots. You need an audit trail that technology cannot tamper with.
