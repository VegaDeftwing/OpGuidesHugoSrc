The fight for the Internet is never ending. At the time of writing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to tie anti §230 legislation to the $2000 stimulus checks, and my own Congress Critter, Ben Sasse (R,Nebraska), along with Jeff Merkley (D,Oregon) are trying to push though **SISEA - the Stop Internet Sexual Exploitation Act**, which on paper sounds like it's doing good to stop the possibility of revenge porn. Unfortunately, they want to do this by **requiring that all people in porn expressly give the site written consent with identity verification**. This is exceedingly stupid for a variety of reasons: 

* This is essentially a restriction on free speech as it makes it illegal for sites to host content that users would very likely *want* to be able to publish anonymously.
* It puts established sex workers at risk, as ~~if a site were to get hacked~~, or rather when a site gets hacked as it's inevitable, that information could be used for a huge variety of horrors. 
* It also seeks to add a 24/7 support line to report content, and limits content in violation to be taken down in under 2 hours. This will be *huge* burden for legitimate sites, and encourage users to go to much darker corners of the internet where content is freely updated, but where the sites have no incentive to comply with laws that are sensible for protecting minors or other vulnerable people.
* It super-ultra fucks undocumented sex workers

The fact that they can claim "oh lookie it's bipartisan!" is really just them trying to sneak a fucking porn ban though. Fuck that.

Please call and write your congress critters, and let them know this is some stupid bullshit. Then ask your friends to do so as well. 

You can use [Find My Representative (house.gov)](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) if you need to look up who represents you.

If you're outside the US, this will still very likely affect you. Hell, PornHub is a Canadian site, but they'll still likely have to comply, so please still spread the message.

# Politics and The Internet

## The important laws you need to understand:

### CDA (no pronz) & §230

> The **Communications Decency Act of 1996** (**CDA**) was the [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress)'s first notable attempt to regulate [pornographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography) material on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). In the 1997 landmark case *[Reno v. ACLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_v._ACLU)*, the [United States Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court) struck the act's anti-indecency provisions.

Alright, so it was some failed law that tried to ban porn? Well, yeah, **BUT** it did pass and was only later, in the afforementioned Reno v ACLU case, struck down - and there, only the anti-indecency provisions. This left one very, very inportant little bit, *Section 230*,  that today the entire internet relies on, **The 26 words that created the internet:**

> **No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider**

[TODO] expand on why 230 is important
