> The **Communications Decency Act of 1996** (**CDA**) was the [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress)'s first notable attempt to regulate [pornographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography) material on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). In the 1997 landmark case *[Reno v. ACLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_v._ACLU)*, the [United States Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court) struck the act's anti-indecency provisions.

Alright, so it was some failed law that tried to ban porn? Well, yeah, **BUT** it did pass and was only later, in the afforementioned Reno v ACLU case, struck down - and there, only the anti-indecency provisions. This left one very, very inportant little bit, *Section 230*,  that today the entire internet relies on, **The 26 words that created the internet:**

> **No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider**
