The fight for the Internet is never ending. At the time of writing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to tie anti ยง230 legislation to the $2000 stimulus checks, and my own Congress Critter, Ben Sasse (R,Nebraska), along with Jeff Merkley (D,Oregon) are trying to push though **SISEA - the Stop Internet Sexual Exploitation Act**, which on paper sounds like it's doing good to stop the possibility of revenge porn. Unfortunately, they want to do this by **requiring that all people in porn expressly give the site written consent with identity verification**. This is exceedingly stupid for a variety of reasons: 

* This is essentially a restriction on free speech as it makes it illegal for sites to host content that users would very likely *want* to be able to publish anonymously.
* It puts established sex workers at risk, as ~~if a site were to get hacked~~, or rather when a site gets hacked as it's inevitable, that information could be used for a huge variety of horrors. 
* It also seeks to add a 24/7 support line to report content, and limits content in violation to be taken down in under 2 hours. This will be *huge* burden for legitimate sites, and encourage users to go to much darker corners of the internet where content is freely updated, but where the sites have no incentive to comply with laws that are sensible for protecting minors or other vulnerable people.
* It super-ultra fucks undocumented sex workers

The fact that they can claim "oh lookie it's bipartisan!" is really just them trying to sneak a fucking porn ban though. Fuck that.

Please call and write your congress critters, and let them know this is some stupid bullshit. Then ask your friends to do so as well. 

You can use [Find My Representative (house.gov)](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) if you need to look up who represents you.

If you're outside the US, this will still very likely affect you. Hell, PornHub is a Canadian site, but they'll still likely have to comply, so please still spread the message.

# Politics and The Internet

{{< tip >}}

Much of the following is pretty complex and anything I can say would just be reiterating things said by those much more qualified than I, so rather than try to explain things in depth, I'll be linking to a lot of external sources. **please** take the time to read these articles and watch the videos.

## The important laws you need to understand:

### CDA (no pronz) & ยง230

> The **Communications Decency Act of 1996** (**CDA**) was the [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress)'s first notable attempt to regulate [pornographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography) material on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). In the 1997 landmark case *[Reno v. ACLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_v._ACLU)*, the [United States Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court) struck the act's anti-indecency provisions.

Alright, so it was some failed law that tried to ban porn? Well, yeah, **BUT** it did pass and was only later, in the afforementioned Reno v ACLU case, struck down - and there, only the anti-indecency provisions. This left one very, very inportant little bit, *Section 230*,  that today the entire internet relies on, **The 26 words that created the internet:**

> **No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider**

In human language, this means Section 230 is what protects Facebook from being liable when some dipshit posts a pirated movie to Facebook, makes a terrorist threat, or just spreads libel. Similarly, it gives the platforms moderation privileges, that is if some nazi joins your group chat, you can give him the boot.

The big problem right now is weather or not fact checking, where a little box shows up under a tweet or YouTube video to say something like "Science knows Climate Change is man made and a big fucking problem" or "Biden won the election, stop being such a little bitch" is allowed, or if it makes the site a *publisher*, there by taking away their ยง230 protections.

Here, this video covers everything I could say a lot better than I can easily write here, so here's the two things I'd say are pretty much required reading, [Section 230 is Good Actually (EFF.org)](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/section-230-good-actually) and this video from DEF CON:

### DMCA (*attempting* to fix 230, poorly)

Alright, so 230 made sites not liable at all (ish) but this actually isn't great either, as what is someone supposed to do if they get their copyrighted work posted online? No reasonable person (or business) can afford to sue literally every time someone posts their shit, so, the DMCA - the *Digital Millennium Copyright Act*-  was born, to steal from Wikipeda:

> It criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as [digital rights management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself.

But this has a whole host of issues. I'm going to redirect this to [This page from the EFF](https://www.eff.org/pages/unintended-consequences-fifteen-years-under-dmca) though, as I think that does a much better job of explaining the issues, and then you might want to read [This list of Criticisms of the DMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act#Criticisms) on the Wikipedia page for the DMCA.

More recently, the [DMCA takedown](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md) of YouTube-dl, a program that lets users download videos from YouTube among many, many other video sites, was a big issue that riled up the technical world, and for which it seems most people think was a flagrant misuse of the DMCA against a tool, not a specific instance of infringing content. Extra stupid when you realize the computer itself could also be argued to be the tool enabling infringement.

#### Exceptions

Alright, so the DMCA is dumpster fire burning with a raging satanic hell blaze which only emits darkness, but thankfully the sentient darkness that represents the American people has carved away a few crumbs that we can use to sustain ourselves with in these dire times. The list below are things for which you can safely outright ignore the DMCA and break into things as you please. I'll go over my favorites, but [here's the list in full on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act#Anti-circumvention_exemptions).

* Ebooks can be stripped for the sake of using a text-to-speech system
* Snippets of Movie/Video DRM can be stripped for the purposes of criticism/review, education, and accessibility
* While not directly stated, an exception for 'Jailbreaking' and 'Rooting' Iphones and Androids was made, so that's allowed.
* Forcing 3D printers to use 3rd party filament
* "Computer programs, where the circumvention is undertaken on a lawfully acquired device or machine on which the computer program operates solely for the purpose of good-faith security research and does not violate any applicable law"
* In general, if you're doing it so you can repair the device, you're all clear as well.

### FOSTA/SESTA (Breaking 230)

[FOSTA and SESTA (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Enabling_Sex_Traffickers_Act), the 'Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act' and 'Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act' are both massive failures. Their original goal is more or less in the name, but even the U.S. Department of Justice said it was a bad idea. Again, I'm going to hand this off to better sources. The first link there, to the wikipedia article, has a large section on the criticism of the bills. I strongly encourage you read it, and [this article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/how-congress-censored-internet) from the EFF does a good job of going into its problems too.

These are the bills that caused [Craigslist to remove their 'personals' section](https://www.craigslist.org/about/FOSTA).

### SOPA & PIPA (Trying to break everything)

SOPA, or the [Stop Online Piracy Act (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) from ~2012 was a *big* deal at the time. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, eBay, Tumblr, Mozilla (Firefox), Mojang (Minecraft), Wikipedia, and more were all active in letting users know this bill was bad news. It was effective, but it was one hell of a fight. [PIPA (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act), the 'PROTECT IP Act' was just the senate version of the bill, but it is still worth reading up on it quickly, especially the 'Reception' section of the linked Wikipedia article.

For a slightly dramatized, dubstep recap: (skip to 2:28) 

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hag2JWC8qZ0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### COPPA & CIPA (Breaking things... For the children!)

[COPA (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Online_Protection_Act), the Child Online Protection Act, passed in '98 and seeks to keep minors online safe, mostly this just resulting in the 'Are you 18?' checks that surely no minor has ever lied to bypass.

Oh, what's that, that's COPA with one 'P', my bad, here's [COPPA (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act#Criticisms), Child Online *PRIVACY* Protection Act. which if you read up on you'll see has been a mess for free speech, hurts small business, fails to protect kids anyway, and only seeks to create an artificial (and broken) 'safe space' online for kids, which is especially dumb as it ignores the most obvious problem: no kid *wants* to be treated like a kid. Moreover, why the *fuck* should kids get privacy protection until 13 and then ope, just like that fuck em' we'll collect all their information and sell it to advertisers, what magical thing happens at 14 that makes collecting and selling your data okay?

[CIPA (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Internet_Protection_Act), the Children's Internet Protection Act, is a free speech fuck you to all children as it requires web filtering. The [ACLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union) and [ALA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Library_Association) both challenged CIPA, arguing that the filtering it would necessitate at public libraries would limit free speech, and they won.... and then lost on appeal, with the stipulation that on request a librarian unblock content for an adult. Of course, this is still a major fuck you to kids. It's more or less normalized school web filters that are far to overzealous, as anybody that went to high school since the 2010's can tell you. Hell, my public school even had sites blocked for 'Alternative Beliefs'.

Look, I'm not against protecting kids online, no 8 year old should be exposed to 2 girls and a cup. I know for a fact that some kids get *fucked up* seeing this shit to early. My mom's a family law attorney, and while obviously case specifics are kept quiet, general ideas like 'saw a kid got addicted to porn because the dad showed it to him' are things I've heard. It's awful. I get it. But you can't stop a shitty parent with legislation no matter how hard you try.

### GDPR (They tried)

{{< tip >}}

Note, unlike the rest of the items in this list, the GDPR is NOT legislation from the United States, instead it's applicable to all EU residents
