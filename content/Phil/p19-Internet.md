> The **Communications Decency Act of 1996** (**CDA**) was the [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress)'s first notable attempt to regulate [pornographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography) material on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). In the 1997 landmark case *[Reno v. ACLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_v._ACLU)*, the [United States Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court) struck the act's anti-indecency provisions.

Alright, so it was some failed law that tried to ban porn? Well, yeah, **BUT** it did pass and was only later, in the afforementioned Reno v ACLU case, struck down - and there, only the anti-indecency provisions. This left one very, very inportant little bit, *Section 230*,  that today the entire internet relies on, **The 26 words that created the internet:**

> **No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider**

[TODO] expand on why 230 is important

Note, unlike the rest of the items in this list, the GDPR is NOT legislation from the United States, instead it's applicable to all EU residents
