<script>document.getElementById("freedomMenu").open = true;</script>

What should you be able to do with your body? The immediate reaction may be "It's my body, so whatever I want!" but think about it really, should everyone have the right to do *anything* they want with their body? What about suicide and self harm? What about when information about you is shared- if you take a DNA test, that impacts everyone related to you.

What should others be able to do with your body? Obviously nobody should be able to force you to do anything, but is it okay for your face to be used in AI recognition by Facebook? What about by law enforcement? Is prison labor ethical?
