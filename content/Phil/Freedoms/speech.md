The freedom of speech is weird, because it's one that most of us recognize is that it should have limits because speech is powerful. The problem comes in what those limits are, which is why there are so many topics under debate:

* Government Secrets <img src="/common/vs.webp" alt="vs" style="height:1em;" /> Whistleblowing
* Hate Speech <img src="/common/vs.webp" alt="vs" style="height:1em;" /> Political/Religious Opinion
* Copyright <img src="/common/vs.webp" alt="vs" style="height:1em;" /> Parody
* Public Health <img src="/common/vs.webp" alt="vs" style="height:1em;" /> Advertising of Sugar/Drugs
* Public Saftey <img src="/common/vs.webp" alt="vs" style="height:1em;" /> Creating Panic
* Encryption <img src="/common/vs.webp" alt="vs" style="height:1em;" /> Self Incrimination
* Flag Burning <img src="/common/vs.webp" alt="vs" style="height:1em;" /> National Pride
* Gag Orders <img src="/common/vs.webp" alt="vs" style="height:1em;" /> National Security
* Porn/Cursing <img src="/common/vs.webp" alt="vs" style="height:1em;" /> Public Decency (and the FCC)
* Advertising <img src="/common/vs.webp" alt="vs" style="height:1em;" /> Spam
* Satire <img src="/common/vs.webp" alt="vs" style="height:1em;" /> Defamation

There's also a question of where things go to far- at what point is speech a legitimate threat, and where is the line for actions that constitute harassment vs just being an asshole? Should freedom of speech only apply to the government, or should we compel large social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, to allow the spread of misinformation and hate or not?

[TODO] Limits, XY plot of how much harm vs risk for shutting down 'good' speech

* Don't Yell Fire
* Don't lie to cause harm "That man punched my baby"
* (Questionable) Don't incite violence "Let's burn down the police station"
