!> This Section of opinionated guides will be getting a massive overhall soon. Content here may not actually reflect my views, and certainly does not reflect the views of all that contribute to the guides. Below is the old version. Much of what is written below will be reconsidered, expanded upon, and redistributed into the seperate chapters below

Hey there.

My name is Vega. This guide is a bit different from the rest. The others may have a fair amount of opinion tossed in (Yes, still hating on Java, Pop Country music, and crappy UX design) but this one is by it's nature going to be a bit more 'preechy'. I think that as somebody educated in complex topics- as engineers tend to be with engineer-y stuff or musicians and artists with copyright- we have a duty to educate others and ourselves with the current and past issues in our respective fields as well as with what we can do personally to just make the world a bit better. So, here goes.



# An Introduction to Philosophy

trolly problem, different philosophical views, etc.









# Old Version, needs migrated:

Because you're now somebody in the know about topics relating to technology and have a deeper understanding about issues that may effect the public, such as [The FBI V Apple encryption case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBIâ€“Apple_encryption_dispute), [Issues regrading internet speed and infrastructure](https://gizmodo.com/why-americas-internet-is-so-shitty-and-slow-1686173744), or [The Government/NSA spying on people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A). There are plenty of issues that weather you like it or not you're one of the few with enough information to truly understand and inform your peers. A well known digital writes and freedom advocacy group you may consider supporting is the [Electronic Frontier Foundation or EFF](www.eff.org), as they do some absolutely incredible work making sure we maintain our digital rights both in the role of consumers as well as hackers, tinkerers, security researchers and nerds. You may consider checking out [Free press](https://www.freepress.net/) as well, though above all else educating yourself and others about issues to end ignorance and fear when it comes to these issues is more valuable than anything else.

Furthermore, there's a general view in the technical community that we should help push adoption of superior platforms. This is usually either for a push for [decentralized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrA7XTDCtok) services like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) or [Dat](https://datproject.org/), or a push for FOSS (Free and Open Source) software like Linux or LibreOffice.

Most in the technical community believe that you should have full control over the devices you own. This is a major factor in why so many technical people host their own servers and build a lot of the crazy things they do. As a result you'll hear a lot about rooting or getting superuser or root on various devices as well as [Right to Repair](https://repair.org/).

Many in the tech community are on the heartbeat of issues surrounding copyright, fair use, and the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) or DMCA as without exceptions, a lot of security research would not be legal and it's of direct importance to issues like software piracy and issues surrounding YouTube's automated ContentID [TODO: add links]

Moving on from that though, there is increasingly a concern about energy consumption and environmental consequences of technology use. Data centers alone are already consuming over 2% of the worlds electricity and that number is set to grow exponentially in the coming years. Because of this having a light, fast, http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ instead of a bloated, JavaScript heavy page actually matters. http://gauthierroussilhe.com/en/posts/convert-low-tech as well as https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2016/05/how-to-go-off-grid-in-your-apartment.html are good sites that go more in depth on this issue. Now, at the same time, I'm not going to act all high and mighty, my desktop and monitors use in excess of 300w, but it is still something to be mindful of.



Finally, I'd like to make a few notes about online communities, trolling, hate speech, and the like. Clearly the tech industry leans significantly on the liberal/libertarian side; however, most of us also strongly support your right to say whatever you like even if we don't support it. This is particularly frustrating when it comes to large, non-grouped online communities like Twitter or Tumblr where except by blocking, everyone is in the same public sphere instead of isolated. While the isolation can have negative effects too, like echo chambers where false information and hate breed, the smaller communities are also beneficial as they allow for a better sense of community and for individual moderation policies decided by the users instead of awkward rules like [Tumblr's](https://gizmodo.com/tumblrs-porn-filter-flags-its-own-examples-of-permitted-1831151178?utm_source=gizmodo_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow&utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_twitter&fbclid=IwAR2cfAMZ5IpJLINVt6WSuLCcu7KX5D83FQ8F4J-DTxbyJFMZ4704-VxTbN4) [NSFW](https://staff.tumblr.com/post/181199101690/hey-tumblr-a-couple-of-weeks-ago-we-announced-an) ban and the chaos that ensued. Clearly the lines between hate speech and trolling and free speech are a problem online, and frankly the internet is young. We haven't really figured out the right way to handle it yet. Should Twitter have the right to remove the Alt-Right or are they to important of a political forum to deny freedom of speech despite being a public company? Is it ethically okay to use services like Tor for privacy when by doing so you're indirectly helping people get away with things like child ... abuse (I don't want this document getting flagged by something, ironically). Or because the tools are going to exist regardless and criminals will always find another way is it okay? The truth is, it's not black and white, and it's well worth your time to sit down and consider what you are personally okay with and what you think, as a society, we need to change and how we might go about doing that. Personally, I think services like Mastodon which offer security and privacy while keeping individual communities free to handle themselves are the best option, but they're also more complicated. Just know that decision you make online can have real world consequences, and that at the end of the day, there's a human on the other side of that screen.

Finally, a little less NSFW, the Maker and engineering communities also tend to overlap rather heavily with more artistically minded and sub-culture heavy groups, ranging from those obsessed with comics to anime nerds or furries. I really recommend you do at least a little research into various sub cultures and geek culture to better understand some of the people you'll probably interact with. You might just find something new you enjoy while you're at it.

Also, because this got a bit heavy for a bit, let's touch on Rule 34. We all know it, but where does it come from? 4Chan of course. Here's the full set:
