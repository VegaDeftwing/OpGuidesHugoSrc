Look, I'll be the first to admit I'm guilty of falling for the tricks used to get people to consume. To buy and buy more. A good sale, even on something I didn't know I previously wanted, still has a way of making my dumb lil' human brain go "OH!"

The *problem* is that consumers can easily fall into traps that lead them to buy things for a stupid reasons, these include:

* Buying something expensive as a status symbol
* Buying the 'New version' which has no meaningful improvement
* Brand Loyalty (not *always* bad)
* Buying from businesses that prevent repairs
* Buying from businesses that abuse workers or their rights

among many, many other things.

Under Capitalism, there are oposing forces here. On the one hand, greater consumption means more jobs, more money flowing, means a better enconomy, means everyone gets to live a better life.

{{< attribution >}}(or at least this is true if you subscribe to the hyper-capitalist propaganda we're fed from birth in the US! Yay, Capitalism is all sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è and rainbows üåà and absolutely can not be criticized or you're an *evil* comunist!){{< /attribution >}}

On the other hand, holy fucking shit everything is on fire. People buy useless shit wrapped in enough plastic to [create a fucking Texas sized trash island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch) in the Pacific, we support companies that actively fight against our [right to repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_right_to_repair) or which make products with extreme [Planned Obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence), and most of us work meaningless jobs just to be able to afford to pay for a fancier car that we will mostly use to *get to* that job. Meanwhile, if you *don't* have a credit card and debt, you're also fucked because you need to maintain a good [Credit Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score#United_States).<a class="ptr">(1)</a>

But the real problem is that we all go to work to pay for shit that we don't need, that we're not allowed to repair or don't even really 'own'<a class="ptr">(2)</a>, that mines our data to advertise to us after we've bought the product<a class="ptr">(3)</a>, that randomly removes features years later<a class="ptr">(4)</a>, that we've been told has value it doesn't<a class="ptr">(5)</a>. It's not turtles all the way down, it's just piles of bullshit.

# Accelerating Change and Information Overload

The world is getting faster. Things are moving, flashing at us, blinking with neon colors and screaming at us in increasing attention grabbing, addicting ways. There's now the attention economy, where time in front of your eyes is evaluated to be worth an increasing amount. An ephemeral cloud of mist, lurking in the air that has been given the moniker *The Algorithm* influences our choices more and more each day.

This sounds like some sort of plot to an 80's scifi thriller set in the far future, but instead it's just part of our [/r/ABoringDystopia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABoringDystopia/) . I know I'm addicted, but that's the funny thing about true addiction, you don't really want to stop. I know that speed of things, the ever increasing nightmare of [political shit slinging](political shit slinging) and the amount of news on it is bad for me. That being only a click away from something more interesting has rotted my attention span. That a culture of consumption has made it harder for me to spend time creating. I know that I could make a conscious decision to limit my time on reddit, or to spend more time outside, but sitting in the same spot is comfortable. I've dug my own little hole and surrounded it on all sides with walls a mile high to protect me from the advertisements and dissenting views, but in the process I've lost so much. I try to read an article on Fox or anything on r/conservative and I get irrationally angry. So instead I keep to browsing my *Algorithmically Tailored* home page, but after seeing things that interest me I get on a bind of *just one more page* or *I'll only scroll to one more post* or *I'll read after this video* and then, even if I do manage to break free and escape into a book, I'm one *~Binng~* of a Telegram notification away from being brought out of my book for something that I find more immediately gratifying.

Then, to add onto that, the censorship, not only are we *algorithmically bound* to see some content over others, but because of strange advertisement, government, and platform policies and the increasing stupid fact that we still use centralized services, the ever increasing amount of excess photons that we didn't even ask for that we get blasted into our retinas is filtered in a way that discourages actual free speech because some people's speech is prioritized.

But, I'm getting off topic, the point of this was to discuss and propose a solution to the issue of being bombarded with information, ads, physical and digital, and content that was not requested.

# Somethings I've written while thinking about this:

>I've posted things like this here before, but I feel like I need to again in light of recent conversations with friends: On Facebook, you are the product and you are you should know what you are funding. I think at this point the Cambridge Analytica scandal[1] is pretty well known, but that is nothing compared to the other things in Facebook's past. At one point Facebook targeted teenagers and filtered their news feed to be mood based which was found to lead to real world mood changes [2]. But even if these things don't bother you, you think Facebook just made a mistake, there's the case of Facebook's content moderation team being paid less than a living wage and being exposed to situations which lead to severe mental illness [3]. Speaking of mental illness, Facebook owned Instagram's recommendation algorithm has been found to recommend pro self-harm content to those most vulnerable, which has actually lead to deaths [4].

>Think about who you're giving your data, money, and views to and on what platform you do so. There are alternatives. You don't have to sell all your data to big organizations to stay in touch. I use Mastodon [5] instead of Twitter, Telegram instead of messenger [6] and a combination of Reddit and the things above instead of Facebook. You do have a choice. If nothing else you can use Facebook in a separate browser or in a container [7] so you're at least not funding them in full.
>
>Just like voting and contributing to your community, having digital responsibility is important too.

>Thanks for reading this, if you want to talk about digital privacy or security you can shoot me a message here and I'll get back to you next time I log in, or you can message me on Telegram and I'll get back to you right away.

>I don't think it's a lack of morals, I think it's a lack of accountability combined with the legal requirement for businesses to do what's in the best interest of shareholders. At some point fines became the cost of doing business, as does lobbying and attempting to get regulatory market capture. While yes I think consumers are guilty of not voting with their wallets for the better alternatives, buying the better alternatives has become impractical when the ones playing dirty can undercut the ones playing nice by such a crazy extent. While I get nobody likes big government, I personally think the best solution is for the FTC, FCC, and EPA to do their jobs: force right to repair, force net neutrality and increase the definition of broadband minimums, implement a carbon tax respectively- among other issues. Capitalism without limits leads to abuse without limits. We complain that Facebook owns basically all of social media, that Amazon workers are peeing in bottles, but still let them buy literally all of their competition before they actually get large enough to compete. We let our politicians take unchecked donations form them that lead to laws that make it even harder for a smaller business to compete or get started, meanwhile not letting them pass any consumer protections like preventing Facebook from knowing when you're on your period or ClearviewAI from scraping profile pictures to build a nationwide facial recognition database that you can't opt out of.
>
>Morals aren't the answer. Regulation with real consequences, consumer protections, unions, blocking mergers, breaking up not just monopolies but even duo and tri and quadopolies (like the media landscape: Sinclar, Fox, Disney) as well as regional non-competes, unfucking that patent system, and undoing the damage Disney did to copyright is. Or at least it would be a start.
>
>I also think it's partially just a matter of there's too much going on in the world for most people to give a shit about everything. "The Good Place" did a good job of pointing this out where in the third(?) season it was revealed nobody had gone to heaven in hundreds of years because people couldn't actually act ethically anymore. They showed a particularly good example where someone didn't make it in because, unbeknownst to them, the apple they bought at the super market had been harvested with slave labor, and like... What are you supposed to do? Trace down every apples path from tree to you?

>Idk man, it just makes me depressed that we have to eternally be careful not to fund douchebags.
