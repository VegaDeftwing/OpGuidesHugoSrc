# Logical Fallacies (and a bit more)

If you've been on the internet for more than about a quarter of a second, you've likely been accused of a whole host of logical fallacies. Unfortunately, most people really don't understand what they're saying and often use a lot of these incorrectly. On the other hand, you also likely encounter ~~politicians~~ people using these fallacies on a regular basis as well, and it's nice to be able to call them out on it. This page is going to cover a fair amount of the most common and attempt to give you examples of when they apply and when they don't: (sources are at the bottom of the page)

## [Argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)

> In [argumentation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory), an ***argumentum ad populum*** (Latin for "appeal to the people") is a [fallacious argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) that concludes that a [proposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositions) must be true because many or most people believe it, often concisely encapsulated as: "If many believe so, it is so".

([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum#cite_note-22))

## [Argument to moderation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation)

Inflation of conflict – arguing that, if experts in a field of knowledge disagree on a certain point within that field, no conclusion can be reached or that the legitimacy of that field of knowledge is questionable.

For example, if most of science says there's 31 elementary particles, but some fringe scientists claim there are 42, that doesn't mean the answer has to be somewhere in between.

Similarly, if most people think the Earth is flat, and some small fringe group of heathens think the earth is round, that doesn't make make the popular opinion right. 

## [Slippery slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope)

"If we let *the gays* marry, what's next, letting people marry horses!?"

## [Begging the question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question) 

This is just a type of circular reasoning, think claims like

"Chocolate is an aphrodisiac because it makes people horny"

Well, no, you just restated the definition of aphrodisiac. That's how *most* 'begging the question' works, by using the definition of a word to support a claim.

## [Cherry picking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking_(fallacy))

> **Cherry picking**, **suppressing evidence**, or the **fallacy of incomplete evidence** is the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position while ignoring a significant portion of related and similar cases or data that may contradict that position.

> **Survivorship bias** or **survival bias** is the logical errorof concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to some false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of [selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias).

> For example, if three of the five students with the best college grades went to the same high school, that can lead one to believe that the high school must offer an excellent education when, in fact, it may be just a much larger school instead. The question cannot be answered without looking at the grades of all the other students from that high school, not just the ones who made the top-five selection process.

## Pareto Principle

## [Ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem)

> Typically this term refers to a rhetorical strategy where the speaker attacks the character, motive, or some other attribute of the person making an argument rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. This avoids genuine debate by creating a diversion to some irrelevant but often highly charged issue. The most common form of this fallacy is "A makes a claim *x*, B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument *x* is wrong".

For example "Bob says that being gay is okay, but Bob is an atheist, so clearly he's wrong"

## [Appeal to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_authority)

## [I'm entitled to my opinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_entitled_to_my_opinion)

> **I'm entitled to my opinion** or **I have a right to my opinion** is a logical fallacy in which a person discredits any opposition by claiming that they are entitled to their opinion. The statement exemplifies a [red herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring) or [thought-terminating cliché](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_cliché). The logical fallacy is sometimes presented as "Let's agree to disagree". Whether one has a particular entitlement or right is irrelevant to whether one's assertion is true or false. Where an objection to a belief is made, the assertion of the right to an opinion side-steps the usual steps of discourse of either asserting a justification of that belief, or an argument against the validity of the objection. Such an assertion, however, can also be an assertion of one's own freedom or of a refusal to participate in the system of logic at hand.

This fallacy, is a bit different from the others as it's not so much a breaking of logical rules so much as willful ignorance and stupidity. It's often used to end arguments to avoid further conflict, which one one thing, but other times it's used outright to stop decent and encourage people to stick to views without letting them be challenged, which is incredibly dangerous. It's exactly what lets hate like homophobia and bad ideas, like anti-vax, spread.

## [Tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)

> The **tragedy of the commons** is a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their collective action.

The easiest way to see this is to talk about an example, so let's assume the case of two criminals, arrested by the police and some weird judicial system where the following is possible:

The police don't have enough evidence to get a large sentence on either perp, if neither fesses up, each gets 2 years in prison. But, they have an idea, they offer either of the criminals to only serve 1 year if they rat out the other, and then the other serves 10 years. If they both rat out each other, then both serve 10 years. Both criminals are given the same offer, but neither is given a chance to coordinate. Each of them, acting in their own self interest, would only have to serve 1 year, but if both do, each has to serve 10. If they chose to rat each other out, that's an example of the tragedy of the commons.

This scales up too, everything from CO2 emissions causing climate change to vaccines can be seen as cases of this.

{{< hint info>}}

Vaccines do have some side effects, usually just a low fever and a sore arm, and **very** rarely something serious. It's just that by having a high enough population vaccinated we can be safe from much much more likely threats like polio. Vaccinate your fucking kids, Karen. Don't contribute to the tragedy of the commons.

## [Self-Censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-censorship)

> **Self-censorship** is the act of censoring or classifying one's own discourse. This is done out of fear of, or deference to, the sensibilities or preferences (actual or perceived) of others and without overt pressure from any specific party or institution of authority. Self-censorship is often practiced by film producers, film directors, publishers, news anchors, [journalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist), musicians, and other kinds of authors including individuals who use social media.

> In authoritarian countries, creators of artworks may remove material that their government might find controversial for fear of sanction by their governments. In pluralistic capitalist countries, repressive judicial lawmaking can also cause widespread ["rivercrabbing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_crab_(Internet_slang)) of Western media.

## [Doomscrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling)

> **Doomscrolling** is the act of consuming a large quantity of negative online news, typically without pause, to the detriment of the mental health of the person consuming it. Essentially, if the news is bad or depressing, one can 'doomscroll' it.

## [Chilling Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect)

> In a legal context, a **chilling effect** is the inhibition or discouragement of the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights by the threat of legal sanction.

> A lawsuit initiated specifically for the purpose of creating a chilling effect may be called a [Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Lawsuit_Against_Public_Participation) ("SLAPP").

## [Streisand Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)

> The **Streisand effect** is a social phenomenon that occurs when an attempt to hide, remove, or censor information has the unintended consequence of further publicizing that information, often via the Internet.

## Think of The Children

{{< hint info >}}

There is a whole class of fallacies in this group, as appeals to emotions like fear, flattery, being part of the in group, loyalty, etc. Covering all of them seems a bit excessive, so instead, just know to look out for any appeals to emotion that attempt to stand in for actual evidence.
