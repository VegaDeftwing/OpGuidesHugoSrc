**BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!** USB 4.0 is a thing now, butttt it's actually based on Thunderbolt 3 and is only on USB-C. But what is Thunderbolt then? Let's move on

... but for the really nerdy that want more, see [USB3: why it's a bit harder than USB2](https://lab.ktemkin.com/post/why-is-usb3-harder/), [How Does A USB Keyboard Work? (Ben Eater, YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdgULBpRoXk), and [How does USB device discovery work? (Ben Eater, YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0O5Uwc3C0o)

## Thunderbolt, Firewire, PS-2?

Alright, so we'll get to Thunderbolt in a second, but first, let's look at how we got here:

okay, so that's the really legacy stuff, but you may also see some FireWire <img src="/FireWire_symbol.svg" alt=" " height="20em"> (IEEE 1394) devices laying around. FireWire was *mostly* found on gear made for Apple devices but it can be found on generic hardware too. It's a bit faster than USB 2.0 but still dramatically slower than 2.0. To use it today, you'll probably need to add an expansion card to your computer, but because of that added cost sometimes you can find good deals on FireWire accessories- just be aware that drivers with FireWire are often a massive pain in the ass.

Finally then, we can get to Thunderbolt!

## Keyboards

HID or Human Interface Device, is the standard over which most mice, keyboards, and game controllers talk to the computer. Unfortunately, it's also a pretty lame standard. You can't just input arbitrary Unicode or send fancy data back to the keyboard to control fancy RGB lights, because of this it's common to need extra drivers per device
