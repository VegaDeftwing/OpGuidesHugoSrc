# Appendix E - It Was Working Just A Second Ago...

Alright, so your code/electronics/computer/life was working fine just a second ago, and now it's just not working at all. Take a deep breath, and relax. Let's work though this.

## Grab a rubber duck

This won't always be applicable, but assuming it's a system- code, or electronics, or a math problem, something that can be analyzed - explain it. Out loud. To a rubber duck. If it's code, do so line by line. if it's electronics, go connection by connection. Don't assume anything is working, just drop all assumptions and find the problem.

## Check your assumptions again.

Did you actually check *all* of your assumptions? Compilers aren't always perfect. Your oscilloscope probe might need calibrated. Don't dive into the weeds until you've double checked everything first, but if you still can't figure it out, dig for what assumptions you're making. Did something actually change between now and when it was last working? Is something else giving you false readings?

... just make sure to stop short of questioning your own sanity.

## Fix by working comparison

Yeah, not always applicable advice, but if you have something that's even similar, first check that it still works, then check for what the differences are between what you're doing and the reference you have.

## Check your Test Cases are Valid

What are your conditions for success? Are you even testing for these conditions correctly?
