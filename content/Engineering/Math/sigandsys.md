But, if you'd rather learn out of a textbook, if you go looking online you might just be able to stumble upon a 100% super-duper legal way to obtain `Alan V. Oppenheim, Alan S. Willsky, with S. Hamid-Signals and Systems` with ISBN `978-0138147570` published by Prentice Hall which is now a subsidiary of Pearson, a textbook publisher which can, and this is 100% true, go fuck themselves.

One of the most important things in Signals is the Fourier Transform. Fortunately, quality content about it is abundant. This site, {{< best >}} [An Interactive Introduction to the Fourier Transform](http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/) {{< /best >}}

provides a great introduction for developing an intuition about it graphically, while "[But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction. (YouTube, 3Blue1Brown)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY)" goes a bit more into the math by the end.

[TODO] put in all notes from class here to provide a half decent resource
