<!-- I'd also like to do something about symbolic analysis with sympy, though since this chapter happens before the programming chapter, that gets awkward. I could make a really funny out-of-order symbol chapter on the website I guess? Regardless, I think I can movitate this well enough and use it as an excues to talk about Domain Specific languages by way of this -> https://thenumb.at/Autodiff/ article. Plus, it's honestly really nice to just through a CAS at a problem. -->
