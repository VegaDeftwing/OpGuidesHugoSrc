# Chapter 13 - Chem

{{< tip >}}

This chapter is more or less on hold while I prioritize adding the content I'm more familiar with, if you'd like, feel free to submit a PR to flesh this section out.

Unfortunately my chemistry education was pretty 'meh', and I never actually made it to Organic Chem. I have CrashCourse's [Chemistry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSyAehMdpyI&list=PLG61LF8I_OXoh2mhx2YNY9s4ekXiriMAf&ab_channel=CrashCourse) and [Organic Chemistry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSMx0NS0XfY&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtONguuhLdVmq0HTKS0jksS4&ab_channel=CrashCourse) videos on YouTube on my 'To Watch' list though. Obviously I don't know if they're any good, but maybe they'd be a decent place to start.
[NileRed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion), [Cody's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/user/theCodyReeder), and [Thought Emporium](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChemlife) on YouTube all have good chemistry content as well.
