# Chapter 16 - Embedded Systems

[TODO]

## What is an Embedded System?

![pos](/pos.png ':size=50%')

## PWM, SPI, I2C, What's going on?!

[Driving a PAL TV over RF thanks to PWM harmonics (Hackaday)](https://hackaday.com/2020/08/26/driving-a-pal-tv-over-rf-thanks-to-pwm-harmonics/)

## Playing around - Hello World and blink

## Making an Embedded System project - 1 - Humidity Sensor

## Making an Embedded System project - 2 - MIDI Controller (with piezzo)

## Making an Embedded System project - 3 - Stepper Motor Music

adapted from floppy drives, but less expensive

## Real Time Operating Systems

RIOT-OS, MBED, etc

[TODO note, MBED was used on the euclidean drum project for its event queue]

talk about scheduling (CFS, etc)

## Other weird and cool projects:

# Chapter 14.1 - Embedded Hardware comparison

[TODO, Pi V RockPi4 V Arduinos V x86, ref architecture information from chapter 3.3]

mention pi sd card performance / stability limits and pi advantages in how common it is

## Arduino â‰  Atmega32p

<p class="tip"> I REALLY want to make this clear: Arduino is a framework. Not a specific hardware platform. Different Arduino devices can run with wildly different specs and support wildly different features. </p>

## STM 32

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First up is the brains of the operation: an STM32F103. Not a lightweight chip: It&#39;s a Cortex M3 @ 72MHz. It&#39;s got 256kB of flash and 48kB of RAM and that&#39;s a 100-pin TQFP package!<a href="https://t.co/oPCeo7XMpe">https://t.co/oPCeo7XMpe</a> <a href="https://t.co/niDPuIFBPT">pic.twitter.com/niDPuIFBPT</a></p>&mdash; Stargirl ðŸŒ  (@theavalkyrie) <a href="https://twitter.com/theavalkyrie/status/1328555704676913153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
