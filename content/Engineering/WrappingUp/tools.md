# A7 - Useful Tools Index

This page exists as an info dump of tools you may find helpful, but didn't know existed - to find the things you didn't know you didn't know.

<!-- Want to add a tool? Please put it on another page and link to it from here. Otherwise, there's a high chance for duplicated effort. -->

## Computer Hardware

* DAS boxes
* Foot switches
* Audio Interfaces

## Basic Electronics Tools
* [Multimeter](/engineering/circuits/intro/2-tools/#the-multimeter) & [Continuity Tester](/engineering/circuits/intro/2-tools/#continuity-tester) (Usually an all-in-one tool)
* [Lab Power Supply](/engineering/circuits/intro/2-tools/#the-lab-power-supply)
* [Waveform Generator](/engineering/circuits/intro/2-tools/#the-frequency-or-waveform-generator)
* [Logic Analyzer](/engineering/circuits/intro/2-tools/#the-logic-analyzer)
* [Osciliscopes](/engineering/circuits/intro/2-tools/#the-oscilloscope)
* [Soldering Iron](/engineering/circuits/intro/2-tools/#soldering-iron)
* [Hot Air Gun](/engineering/circuits/intro/2-tools/#heat-gun)

* Cable testers - Find power only USB cables
* Test loads

## Radio-y stuff

* Vector Network Analyzers (NanoVNA)
* Software Defined Radios
* Dummy Loads

# Other

* Multi-band UV flashlights
* Gamma Spectrometer (Ex: Radiacode)

* Camera mounting systmes
    * Cheeseplates
    * Articulating Arms
    * "Magic Arms"
    * to Vesa
    Weirdly common if you start looking for it

* 3rd hands

* [Rack mount mount enclosures](/engineering/circuits/parts/#enclosures--environmental-protection)

* Cable testers - Find power only USB cables

* Dremel Saws

* IR Camera

* Forge

* USB Microscopes

* Spectrometers (Hamamatsu C12880MA)

* Surface plates - See guitar planes

* Borescope
* Ultrasonic Cleaners
* Laser cutters / CNC (Most are bad)
* 3D Printers

* PCR thermal cycler and other bio tools (See Thought Emporium)



In general, any sensor you could ever want is available, affordable, and dead simple to wire up to a microcontroller to get data out.
