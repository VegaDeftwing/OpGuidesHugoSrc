# Appendix 4 - Vibe Coding

So I figured as big as this has gotten, I should make some kind of statement. So here it is.

It's 2025 as I type this, which means there is a new way for those who cannot code to "hack" the system and get into programming. Maybe even get VC money!

This one is called "Vibe Coding" named after a famous Tweet. (Honestly anyone still using twitter at this point has got to be a meme themselves.) In a nutshell, you use specially modified IDEs and new services offered by LLM cloud companies ("agents") to do all the work of programming for you in response to a prompt.

For a more technical and thoughtful take, [Cendyne did an excellent in-depth write up on it](https://cendyne.dev/posts/2025-03-19-vibe-coding-vs-reality.html). Honestly, that contains most of what I would say and more, so please go read it.

On this website, which is about *knowledge and learning*, I'll just be short and sweet:

* This will not help you learn anything. LLMs can be a teaching tool, but the point of this is to skip that process entirely.
* This is a *demerit* to any future job prospects in technical fields. If a university degree shows an ability to learn, then this shows a desire to take shortcuts.
* Most of the stories you may have heard are pioneers' luck, actual lies and scams, or ended up burning out just as quickly as they appeared. "Don't believe everything you read on the internet" and "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" are your friends here.

I hope instead you will find the *entire rest of this section* much more engaging and useful to your journey.

Because it is a journey, and there are no shortcuts.
