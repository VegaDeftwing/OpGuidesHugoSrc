[TODO] I also have discreete math in the chapter 11, math... not sure what do do about this...

Truth tables, binary, logical equlivencies, propositional logic,

Sets, functions, relations, recurrence, induction, combonation, graphs, isomorphsm,

## Complexity analysis

### Brute Force

## Divide and Conquer



## Data structures

trees, hashtables/maps, stacks

## Practice

Fib, some practice logical equliv, base conversion algo, overlapping lines, matrix multiplication

## Locality

### Temporal

### Spatial

## Dynamic Programming

Heads up, this is a 5 hour video:
