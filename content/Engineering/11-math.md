The next few chapters are, regrettably, necessary for developing your knack. Math, Physics, and Chemistry and fundamental to all engineering fields and while something about each of the three subjects finds a way to make the 16 year old highschooler in us release a long, exasperated groan. I think this is mostly due to each of these things being taught in a way that takes the fun and interesting parts out and replaces them with trying to learn skills that have largely been outdated by the advent of calculators, computers, and the internet. With that, let's jump into it:

Why, where are these used, etc.

bring up music things, part failure rates, tollerences, etc.

### Basics

Statistical Independence

Conditional probability

Sub experiments & Tree diagrams

Law of total probability

Bayes Rule

Counting methods

combinations and permutations

with or without replacement

### Random Variables

Probability Mass Function (PMF)

Types of RV's

| Distribution Name | PMF  | Mean | Variance |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Bernoulli         |      |      |          |
| Geometric         |      |      |          |
| Binomial          |      |      |          |
| Pascal            |      |      |          |
| Discrete Uniform  |      |      |          |
| Poisson           |      |      |          |

Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

functions of Random Variables

Families of continuous RVs

Conditional Probability Mass Fn & Conditional Expected Value

Gaussian Random Variables / Normal RVs (same thing)
