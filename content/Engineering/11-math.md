The next few chapters are, regrettably, necessary for developing your knack. Math, Physics, and Chemistry and fundamental to all engineering fields and while something about each of the three subjects finds a way to make the 16 year old highschooler in us release a long, exasperated groan. I think this is mostly due to each of these things being taught in a way that takes the fun and interesting parts out and replaces them with trying to learn skills that have largely been outdated by the advent of calculators, computers, and the internet. With that, let's jump into it:

# Chapter 11 - Math

some motivation, Klein bottle guy, non-euclidean games, fractals, colatz conjecture, ...

## 1 - Algebra

### Number Systems

#### ℕ - Natural Numbers

#### ℤ - Integers

#### ℚ - Rational Numbers

####   - Irrational Numbers

#### ℝ - Imaginary Numbers

#### ℂ - Complex Numbers

[Hypercomplex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomplex_number) are also a thing, this term includes [Quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) which are used in some very high level physics, but otherwise you'll most likely never work with these.

### Notation

#### +, -, *, ÷, mod

#### ^, √, !

#### <, >, ≤, ≥, ±, ≠, ≈, ∝, <<, >>,

#### ±, |x|, ∆

#### *f* (*x*), (*f* ∘ *g*)

#### (*a*,*b*), [a, b]

#### ∑, Π

## 7 - Signals & Systems

{{< hint warning >}}

There's a ton of content available on Signals and Systems in Video form, but honestly I don't think any of it is great. The MIT OpenCourseWare series linked below is probably the best I can find, but it's also still only 480p

{{< /hint >}}

[MIT Signals and Systems Lectures (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FHm2pQmiSM&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61kdPAOC7CzFjJZ8f1eMUxs&ab_channel=MITOpenCourseWare)

But, if you'd rather learn out of a textbook, if you go looking online you might just be able to stumble upon a 100% super-duper legal way to obtain `Alan V. Oppenheim, Alan S. Willsky, with S. Hamid-Signals and Systems` with ISBN `978-0138147570` published by Prentice Hall which is now a subsidiary of Pearson, a textbook publisher which can, and this is 100% true, go fuck themselves.

One of the most important things in Signals is the Fourier Transform. Fortunately, quality content about it is abundant. This site, [An Interactive Introduction to the Fourier Transform](http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/), provides a great introduction for developing an intuition about it graphically, while "[But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction. (YouTube, 3Blue1Brown)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY)" goes a bit more into the math by the end.

[TODO] put in all notes from class here to provide a half decent resource
