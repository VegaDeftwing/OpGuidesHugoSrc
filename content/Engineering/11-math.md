The next few chapters are, regrettably, necessary for developing your knack. Math, Physics, and Chemistry and fundamental to all engineering fields and while something about each of the three subjects finds a way to make the 16 year old highschooler in us release a long, exasperated groan. I think this is mostly due to each of these things being taught in a way that takes the fun and interesting parts out and replaces them with trying to learn skills that have largely been outdated by the advent of calculators, computers, and the internet. With that, let's jump into it:

# Chapter 11 - Math

some motivation, Klein bottle guy, non-euclidean games, fractals, colatz conjecture, ...

## 7 - Signals & Systems

{{< hint warning >}}

There's a ton of content available on Signals and Systems in Video form, but honestly I don't think any of it is great. The MIT OpenCourseWare series linked below is probably the best I can find, but it's also still only 480p

{{< /hint >}}

[MIT Signals and Systems Lectures (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FHm2pQmiSM&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61kdPAOC7CzFjJZ8f1eMUxs&ab_channel=MITOpenCourseWare)

But, if you'd rather learn out of a textbook, if you go looking online you might just be able to stumble upon a 100% super-duper legal way to obtain `Alan V. Oppenheim, Alan S. Willsky, with S. Hamid-Signals and Systems` with ISBN `978-0138147570` published by Prentice Hall which is now a subsidiary of Pearson, a textbook publisher which can, and this is 100% true, go fuck themselves.

One of the most important things in Signals is the Fourier Transform. Fortunately, quality content about it is abundant. This site, [An Interactive Introduction to the Fourier Transform](http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/), provides a great introduction for developing an intuition about it graphically, while "[But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction. (YouTube, 3Blue1Brown)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY)" goes a bit more into the math by the end.

## 8 - Probability/Stats

Why, where are these used, etc.

bring up music things, part failure rates, tollerences, etc.

### Basics

Statistical Independence

Conditional probability

Sub experiments & Tree diagrams

Law of total probability

Bayes Rule

Counting methods

combinations and permutations

with or without replacement

### Random Variables

Probability Mass Function (PMF)

Types of RV's

| <p class="tip">☠☠☠</br>    Seriously, <b>backup your shit.</b> I've done this countless times and have still managed to accidentally wipe a drive. There's a non-0 chance you're about to completely murder your windows install, It shouldn't happen, but it can. This is a necssary evil to learn, and I assure you'll be happy you've done all this, but this next bit is actual hell for people. I'm sorry it gets so bad so early. I promise it's worth it, okay?The next section requires a lot of reboots and has steps where you can't have this guide open on the computer you're working on. Don't be stupid.</br>☠☠☠ </p> |      |      |          |
