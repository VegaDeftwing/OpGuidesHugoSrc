# Chapter 14 - Circuits & Semiconductors

[TODO]

Show everything in a circuit sim, fix heading levels (this is a mess)

Possibly break up this chapter? Transistors, the opamp, etc alone may each justify their own chapters

That said, I don't want to get to in the mud of transistor physics. I really want to focus on how/when/why to use what, not how they work as the physics is both pretty hard to grasp and not super useful. Still would like to mention that switching is what uses power and like processe size things, but maybe not the chemistry or electron tunneling effects

## Continued Reading:

[TODO]

At this point I highly recommend *'Practical Electronics for Inventors'* ISBN 978-1259587542, namely chapters 2-12, and 15-16. It's a very large, detailed book that does it's best to keep things, well, practical.
