# Chapter 24 - 

{{< tip >}}

This chapter has been merged with another, leaving the space open for now, I'll put something else here...

Maybe reverse engineering? This would seem a bit out of place though. I might need to do some rearranging of chapters 26-34 anyway https://github.com/mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering
