# Appendix C - BOM

{{< tip >}}

As the guide isn't anywhere near a usable state yet, this page should be ignored for the most part.

OpGuides **is** free. Unfortunately all the tools and programs you'll need to follow along aren't necessarily. While you probably could do everything in this guide without getting the things in this Bill OF Materials (BOM) it will massively help to have it.

I'll do my best to keep the cost as low as possible though. If you need help confirming something in your cart is correct just hit me up.

OR

You can find a used Dell Poweredge r610 or poweredge 1950. Many of these will come with out drives, but this option is probably cheaper than the above for better specs. However; these servers are LOUD, loud enough to not be comfortable in the same room and absolutely drink power. As mentioned in the server section, the hardware you use really doesn't matter, you'll just want at least two hard drives, an OS drive, and multiple network interfaces are encouraged. These things can all be added to just about any desktop though, so going to electronics thrift stores or auctions and finding a desktop works too.
