# Chapter 8 - Low Level Programming

## Why C++?

This chapter of OpGuides will be mostly C++, but, why? Well, there's only really a few options for learning low level programming that make sense to start with. C, C++, Rust are the 'big three' that come to mind for me. C is awesome. It's spec is small, it's been kept minimal, and it's got a ton of tools to help you learn. It forces you to know the low level, which in this case is great. C++ has grown into behemoth where any thing can be done in about a dozen different ways and each development team is effectively writing in their own dialect of C++. 

On the other hand, C has a lot of annoyances due to its minimalism. For example, there are no strings - only arrays of characters - and all memory management is manual.

Rust is cool, but I think it's more of a language you need to grow into understand why someone would want to use it. It's very rigid and does a very good job of preventing memory mistakes and making sure the programmer has handled any errors that could come their way (What do you do if you go to open a file and it's not there, for example).

Ultimately, I chose to write this about C++ because it's what I see being used for most larger projects and more and more embedded programming is in C++ instead of C.

Thankfully, the two are pretty similar, as C++ is a superset of C - that is it's C with a whole wack ton of added features (for better or worse)

What this really means is that should you need to go back and learn C it's more so learning to cope with having less of the features of C++.

I'll try to teach the C way of doing things as I go anyway though, so honestly think of this more like 

## Don't throw out everything you already know!

[TODO] loops, while, etc.

## Some simple programs, in C++

TODO: [30 Seconds of C++ (Github)](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp)

### Hello World!

It's traditional to start in any language by writing a program that just outputs the words "Hello World!" to the terminal, so let's start there in C++

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
    return(0);
}
```

To run this code, save it to a file named `hello.cpp` and then open a terminal, navigate to that folder and run `g++ hello.cpp -o hello`, then you can run your program with `./hello`, that should give you something like this:

```
[vega@lyrae ~]$ g++ hello.c -o hello
[vega@lyrae ~]$ ./hello
Hello World!
```



Alright, so let's go though line by line.

On line **1** there's a `#include` statement, this tells the compiler we want to include some library or other code. In this case we want the `iostream` library, as well need it in a few lines, but what about this library, where is it?

Well, that library is just some other code. We can look at it by navigating to `/usr/include/c++/[version]` (at time of writing the version is 10.2.0) or, in VSCode you can hold control and click on the word *iostream* to go it's file, so let's look at that file:

okay, so it starts with a big copyright block in comments - in C++ `//` makes a single ling comment and `/* comment */` are for multi-line comments - then on lines 39 and 40 we can see it is in turn including three more files- `bits/c++config.h`, `ostream` and `istream`, and then there's some code that links in these external resources... Let's go deeper! I won't be including the content of the files in full, but here's some snippit of `c++config.h`

The syntax highlighting on this page isn't doing us any favors here, but if you're following along in VSCode you should see that this file is entirely comments and these blocks starting with `#`, and these `#` blocks do have some highlighting, so what's up?

{{< tip >}}

These files don't end in a  **.cpp** extension, so you may have to tell VS code that the files are c++ files by clicking where it says 'plain text' in the lower right and selecting c++

{{< /tip >}}

These are all pre-processor directives, just like `#include` is, basically, it's special code that the compiler (in our case `g++`) looks at before it makes the program, here it's looking at the version of C++ we're using and deciding how to set things up based on that. Let's go back a to the `iostream` file though, and then dive into `ostream` this time instead

okay, so, this actually has some real code. I'm not going to try to interpret it, and neither should you. This little adventure was just to show you that these `#include` statements that use system libraries are not magic.

Okay, so, that's done. Line **2** of our 6 line hello.cpp is just 'white space' or a blank line, so we can skip it. Line **3** is where things get interesting again, with `int main() {`. The `main()` function is special, as without doing something [weird](https://www.techiedelight.com/c-program-without-main-function/), it's where your code starts from. you may often see this line as `int main(int argc, char** argv) ` too, which I'll get to in a bit.

So, lets break this down, starting with `int`.

C++ is a statically typed language, this means that each variable has a defined type, but also that each function has a defined type it returns and expects to be given.

so, with `int main() {` we're saying the `main()` function will return an integer. skipping ahead a bit, we can see this is the case, as on line 5, `return(0)` it does exactly that, but, why?

{{< columns >}}

Let's run our code as is (`./hello`), then change this return code to `return(2);`, recompile with `g++ hello.cpp -o hello` and run `./hello` again.

See that little `2 âµ` in my terminal? That's the return code, but why did it get printed?

Well, when the program exits, it returns that number to the process that called it (In this case the shell - read up on shell vs terminal in Appendix A1) and if this number is anything but `0` the shell prints it, because anything but `0` is assumed to be an error condition, and that this number may indicate what that error was. So, if we know getting to that `return(0)` signifies that our program ran correctly, we should, in fact, return `0`.

<--->

<img src="/returncodes.png" alt="Return Codes" height="300em"></br>

{{< /columns >}}

Okay, So, other than the closing curly brace (`}`) on line **6** that defines the end of main, with 

```c++
int main(){
//code goes here between the curly braces
}
```

We only have one line left to look at, and that's line **4**, which is

```c++
std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
```

Okay, breaking it up, we first see `std::cout`

the `std` part of that is saying that the `cout` function is defined in the `std` namespace.

And, so the rabbit hole continues. Rather than attempt to rewirte my own explanation, [This page (Tutorialspoint.com)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_namespaces.htm) does a good job of explaining name spaces. 

Regardless, as we saw before, `cout` is imported from the `iostream` library, so, we do have it in our code.

Okay, so then we have the `<<` operator. This is admittedly, a tad on the confusing side. in C++ this operator is traditionally a bitwise shift, so shifting a bit one place to the left, that is appending a 0 onto the binary string, so normally that would be like

```c++
int x = 0b11 << 1
```

`0b11` in binary is 3, (the 0b prefix means binary) 1 here is the number of places we want to shift it left, so, x would now contain `0b110` which is 6.

But, if that's the case then why are we using binary shifts to take text from a string to the output.

Well, that's because C++ is weird and let's you do 'operator overloading' and this is why they did for the standard input output library.

Basically, you can make an operator do something other than it's original purpose. For example, [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-c/), it is used pretty logically, to make adding two complex numbers actually return the correct result.

With the cout function, it just happened that using `<<` for directing a string to output and `>>` for input with something like `cin >> userInput`  is actually a rather convenient way to represent it even if it is a bit weird when taken literally.

Okay, so, we now have almost everything, last up is just the string that we're writing to `cout`, which is `"Hello World!\n"`

Well, to understand this line we'll need our helpful friend, the ASCII table.

<img src="/ASCII-Table-wide.svg" alt="Arch Logo" height="600em" style="-webkit-filter: invert(100%);background: #eee;">

{{< hint info>}}

On most unix based systems you can access this at any time by running `man ascii`

{{< /hint >}}

ASCII is a really old way for computers to represent text. In most modern systems it's been replaced by unicode (which is what let's you use emjois ð¤) but the start of the the much larger character space of Unicode is the [same as the ASCII table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters) anyway. Alright, so, you'll notice some really weird characters in the ASCII table, not just the normal symbols you'd expect. The one I'd like to mention now though is at 0xA - `[LINE FEED]`

Line Feed, as well as some others like Bell and Carriage Return all date back to when computers were hooked up to [Teletype machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33) - which were basically a mix of printer with a typewriter, so, naturally, there had to be some control characters to do things like tell the machine to move to the next line.

Because we like backwards comparability so very much, we still use these same codes for modern terminals, so typing `\n` at the end of a line is really saying "put a line feed control code here" which, to a modern system, means go to the next line.

The reason we do this is because without it, the output of our program looks like this (ran first as is, then with the `\n` removed)

```
[vega@lyrae ~]$ ./hello
Hello World!
[vega@lyrae ~]$ g++ hello.cpp -o hello
[vega@lyrae ~]$ ./hello
Hello World![vega@lyrae ~]$
```

see how it doesn't leave room for the prompt to be printed on a new line of it's own!

The ASCII table has some other interesting side effects too. See how a capital 'A' has an 'index' 32 higher than a lower case 'a', and the same for 'B' to 'b'. Let's use this to our advantage to make the 'd' in 'Hello World!" uppercase.

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    //move the greeting into a variable so we can play with it
    string greeting = "Hello World!\n";
    //print it as is first
    cout << greeting;
    /* 
    *  C++ is '0' indexed, this means that
    * 'H' is at position 0, 'e' is at 1, and so on.
    *  We want to change 'd' which is at pos 10.
    *  so we access the charecter in the string with the
    *  syntax variableName[indexOfCharacter]
    */ 

    // The following line is equivilent to greeting[10] = greeting[10] - 32;
    greeting[10]-=32;
    cout << greeting;

    // note, we could have just changed the character directly,
    greeting[10]='z';
    cout << greeting;
    
    // Let's break that line feed character too, why not.
    greeting[12]='?';
    cout << greeting;
    
    // Still broken, but the iostream lib gives us 'endl' to avoid the need for
    // '\n' in the first place
    cout << greeting << endl;

    return(0);
}
```

```
[vega@lyrae ~]$ g++ hello.cpp -o hello
[vega@lyrae ~]$ ./hello
Hello World!
Hello WorlD!
Hello Worlz!
Hello Worlz!?Hello Worlz!?
[vega@lyrae ~]$
```

This program should actually provide the VAST majority of the source code, with purposeful errors for demonstating the below

furthermore, the C code should check to see if there is a new article, and if so it should call a function that
first checks a 'meta' entry to see if the python code to change a published time to be newer or the number of entries has changed to optimize:

- generates a template markdown file for the article if PUBLISHED is FALSE and no file for it exists,

- generates a template markdown file for the article if PUBLISHED is TRUE and no file for it exists,

- generates a html file from the markdown if PUBLISHED is TRUE and no html exists then updates TEDIT, TPUB

- remove the html file if PUBLISHED is FALSE and an html file for it exists,

however, every time this will still need checked to monitor the md for changes, using ionotify

- generates a new html from the markdwon if PUBLISHED is TRUE and md has changed then updates TEDIT

- if markdown is removed, the html file should be as well

### Debugging it

So, by now you've written a fair amount of code, and I'm sure you've figured out that a bunch of tiny issues can get really annoying. Maybe you keep forgetting semicolons, maybe you wrote '=' instead of '==' when doing an equality check, whatever. Turns out, there's an easier way to catch these kind of errors and it's available for most languages. Allow me to introduce you to...

#### Linting:

Yeah, it's literally named after the fluff you'd find in your hoodie pockets, but, it's still a super necessary tool. A 'Linter' is a [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) tool, basically it makes sure you're code is good before you run it. There's a whole bunch of linters out there. As a pretty stupid example, lets look at this python:

{{< columns >}}

Here's our stupid simple example, here we want a program to show us the output of sin(1...10)

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
if __name__ == "__main__":

    for i in range(0,10):
        math.sin(x)
    pass
```

If we run this code anyway, we'll see python print:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/vega/test.py", line 5, in <module>
    math.sin(x)
NameError: name 'math' is not defined

```

<--->

This code intentionally has a few issues stopping it from running, thankfully the Linter, in my case VSCode's Pylance, found them both:

```
[5,9]  : "math" is not defined
[5,18] : "x" is not defined    
```

Here, it's saying on Line 5, character 9, (where the word `math` starts) I have no function named math. Furthermore, on the same line, but character 18, the variable `x` is not defined. Running the program did already tell us that we didn't have `math` defined, but this caught that `x` was undefined too. Let's fix up the code, and add some print debugging while we're at it.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import math

if __name__ == "__main__":

    for i in range(0,10):
        print("The value of sine(",i,") is ", math.sin(i))
    pass
```

{{< /columns >}}

now running our code yields this:

```
the value of sine( 0 ) is  0.0
the value of sine( 1 ) is  0.8414709848078965
the value of sine( 2 ) is  0.9092974268256817
the value of sine( 3 ) is  0.1411200080598672
the value of sine( 4 ) is  -0.7568024953079282
the value of sine( 5 ) is  -0.9589242746631385
the value of sine( 6 ) is  -0.27941549819892586
the value of sine( 7 ) is  0.6569865987187891
the value of sine( 8 ) is  0.9893582466233818
the value of sine( 9 ) is  0.4121184852417566
```

But, remember I said we want sine(1...10)? The linter no longer has any problems listed, so what's up? Well, that's a limit of static analysis, it can only find errors that occur statically and it's not able to read your mind. Here, the issue is that python's `range()` function is inclusive of the first number, and not the second, so it should be `range(1,11)` to work correctly.

So, what can and can't static analysis do (with some exceptions depending on language and linter):

{{< columns >}}

**STATIC ANALYSIS CAN:**

* (Usually) tell you missed something trivial, like forgetting a semicolon at the end of a line
* (If in a strongly typed language) Tell you if you're doing something stupid with types
  *    `int x = 10; String y = "test"; int z = x + y;` would tell you to quit being a dunce
* Let you know if you're doing something that's bad practice
  * Often code formatting, like warning you that a line is super fucking long and is why you have a tiny horizontal scroll bar.
* Warn you about unused variables
* Warn you about undeclared variables and functions
* Warn you about some math fuckups (divide by 0, integer overflows, etc.)
* Warn you about some out of bound accesses (accessing the k+1 element of an array with k elements
* Warn you if you try to derefrence a null pointer
* Tell you about *some* dead (un-reachable) code.
* find *some* security issues
* find *some* memory leaks

<--->

**STATIC ANALYSIS CAN NOT:**

* Read your mind - if you write a an `add(a,b)` function as `int add(int a, int b) { return(a * b) }` it won't know you fucked up
* Know what is relevant - it's not uncommon to get a huge pile of warnings you don't care about while doing initial development. This can make for a sea of problems that is just... exhausting
* *Always be right* - There are occasional false positives
* Find all issues - It's in the name, it's *static* analysis. Not Dynamic. Your code is dynamic. It runs, it lives. Static Analysis is just doing a once-over to let you know if there's something super obviously wrong, not doing in depth diagnostics.
* Stop you from writing stupid, inefficient, insecure, and otherwise shit code.
  * You want to implement the the obnoxiously slow recursive version of the fibonacci function? It won't stop you.
