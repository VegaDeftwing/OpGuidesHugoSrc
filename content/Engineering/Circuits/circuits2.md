# Chapter 24 - Circuits & Semiconductors

{{< columns >}}

When I was a kid I thought about circuits as being alive, like [Cells at Work!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cells_at_Work!), only little electrons going around busily keeping the heart of my toy working instead of anthropomorphic red blood cells working in the human body.

Now, as an adult - and a computer and electrical engineer at that - I still find this thought endearing. Though I've now come to see the physics and art of electronics to be even more beautiful when their true nature is really understood.

There's a joke you'll hear about those that work with these low level physics or that arrange logic gates to make full CPUs- that our job and passions boil down to teaching rocks to think.

So, let's lean how to teach some rocks.

<!--Show everything in a circuit sim, fix heading levels (this is a mess)-->

<!--Possibly break up this chapter? Transistors, the opamp, etc alone may each justify their own chapters-->

<!--That said, I don't want to get to in the mud of transistor physics. I really want to focus on how/when/why to use what, not how they work as the physics is both pretty hard to grasp and not super useful. Still would like to mention that switching is what uses power and like process size things, but maybe not the chemistry or electron tunneling effects, at least not in great detail-->

# Chapter 24.1 - Semiconductors

TODO, looks very good briefly scrolling through it: https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/electronics/

Digilent's 'Real Analog' course looks okay too, and I might write this guide assuming their analog parts kit: https://learn.digilentinc.com/classroom/realanalog/

## Diodes, the one way road

> A **diode** is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other.

Alright, so in very basic terms, it's a part that only lets current flow in one direction (ideally). A one-way road for current. If you put a sine wave in, you'll get a sine-wave chopped in half out. Now, this assumes everything is ideal, as you'll really get more like the top 40% of the wave out, but we'll get to those details in a bit. For now, I recommend watching these videos:

### These things aren't actually ideal!

* Not all OpAmps are rail-to-rail, meaning if you give them -12 and +12 V rails, you may only be able to hit -10 and +10 or so.
* OpAmps **really** need clean power. If you don't put a small cap to filter the power right at the OpAmps VCC and Gnd pins, except noise.
* There will almost certainly be at least a little bit of DC shift in the output
* You do not actually have infinite gain
* You do not have infinite bandwidth
* They do not actually have infinite input resistance, it's just really high.
