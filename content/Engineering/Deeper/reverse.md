# Chapter 34 - Reverse Engineering

Anyone know of good resources for learning binary reversing?
Not particular tools necessarily, but like theory and how to think

[An Opinionated Guide on How To Reverse Engineer Software](https://margin.re/media/an-opinionated-guide-on-how-to-reverse-engineer-software-part-1.aspx) is decent.

for me personally:

know some assembly, and in particular make sure you know the calling conventions for your platform.

when starting out, do it on binaries you can actually run in a debugger and see what's actually happening at runtime.

learn common patterns for things like "looping over an array", "iterating over a linked list", etc. this is very important.

the process, at least for me and most of the folks i've talked to, is one of iteration - start with what you know, use that to figure out other stuff. now you know more things, repeat.

So:

1. go for easy wins as much as you can. Strings! I love strings (mind you I don't do malware much). See a printf("access_check: ACL rule %d check denies action %s for user %s", foo, bar, baz)? Rename that function to access_check, rename foo to "acl_rule", rename bar to "acl_action", rename baz to "user". Now follow those back as far as you can, with everything that calls access_check. Something calls access_check(woof, bark, meow)? woof is acl_rule, bark is acl_action, meow is user. if you use Binary Ninja right it'll do a lot of this for you, not sure about other tools these days.

Look for logging functions especially - not only are they helpful, often they're called by macros that pass the function name as an argument - you can set the name of hundreds of functions with a script that way.

Also, symbols obviously help- not just exported/local symbols either. Use imports! if something's passed as the first argument to open, that's a filename.

2. structs structs structs structs. again, binary ninja does really well here because it propagates type information. but for most binaries I encounter, figuring out a handful of structs and looking at how they're passed between functions pretty much makes it clear exactly what's going on.
3. DON'T GET STUCK. if you can't figure out roughly what a function does (enough to give it a name) within a few minutes or so of looking at it, bookmark the function and move on- reverse other stuff. Very good chance that'll make it obvious what the function does. If not - remember why you are reversing this binary. If you're doing it to hunt for vulns... does the function handle user input or do security-critical things? If not, MOVE ON. 
4. Cheat! see an interesting string? Google it, and search GitHub for it! You never know where open-source code pops up... (or where some helpful engineer has accidentally put proprietary code on GitHub). Not sure what protocol something's using? Look up the company's engineers on LinkedIn- what do they have experience with? Don't be afraid to use things other than the specific binary you're reversing to figure out how it works.

---

oh also if you see a function with loads of xrefs to it that seems really complicated, maybe does a bunch of bitwise operations, maybe uses weird vector instructions you don't understand, and takes at least one pointer as an argument... it's probably memcpy/memset/bzero/str[n]len/str[n]cpy. if it's not obviously something else, assume it is - if its prototype matches memcpy's, call it memcpy_maybe and DON'T GET STUCK trying to figure it out exactly unless something else means you need to (e.g. if a vuln would be exploitable only if it's strncpy instead of memcpy
