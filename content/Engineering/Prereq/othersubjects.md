# Chapter 9 - 'The Rest'

## English

Unfortunately, for those that don't speak English as a first language, the internet has developed in such a way that English is basically the go-to language online. <a class="ptr">(1)</a>

I'm not going to pretend to be able to teach you English - especially not in a guide that claims to be about Engineering - but I do think communicating effectively is massively important, so I'd recommend watching some of these videos and reading these links which go over some of the nuance of communication:

## Finance

[TODO] because making and engineering are expensive, and you probably want to make money, and spend less money.

## Music

Music? In a chapter on Engineering? Well, yeah. Hear me out, music is a combination of math and signals.

As another example, the Euclidean Algorithm can be used to distribute drum hits to algorithmically make drum beats

As a really cool example, there's also [ORCΛ](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca) by 100 rabbits, which you can see in action in this video from EZBOT on YouTube:

If you get into Modular music systems, like eurorack, it's really similar to programming too- as you connect modules as if they're functions and operations- to make a complex musical system. Here's an example of a Eurorack setup in action from Lightbath on YouTube:

## World Studies

[TODO] To help with tolerance and looking at things from new perspectives.

## History

[TODO] inspiration from history and remembering past mistakes

## Art, Design, UI & UX

I know what you're thinking, "Vega, this guide is about engineering- why should I give a damn about art?"

Because you'll still probably need to design enclosures, make easy to read documentation, and probably make a user interface or two, and bad design usually leads to both users not being interested in the first place *and* a poor user experience.

So, even if you're not super into it, give the [Design Chapters]({{< relref "Design/basics" >}}) a quick skim and look at the parts that seem relevant to you, you'll want to look at [Section 4 - UI/UX]({{< relref "Design/uiux" >}}) for sure.

If you'd like a good laugh, check out this video from Tantacrul roasting the poor design of *Sibelius*, a popular program for music notation

<li>Okay, so, some context is necessary here. Historically, England sorta gave the whole "World Domination" thing a shot as colonialism and in the process spread English to, well, everywhere? This has also had the side effect of quite a few languages becoming [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_endangered_languages). So, you might want to balance in what languages you write online for the sake of preserving your culture. Regardless, the internet will still *expect* you to communicate in English in most places, and this will often be *enforced* by moderation only allowing languages that they can easily read- Often strictly English. For better or worse, English is becoming the world's universal language.</li>
