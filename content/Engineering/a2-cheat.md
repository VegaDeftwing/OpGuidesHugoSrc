# Appendix B - Cheat Sheets and quick info

## Electrical Part Tables

[TODO]

* package types

* reading specs

* datasheets

## Markdown

```html
# heading1
## heading2
### heading3

--- on it's own line will give you a diveder line

* for a bulleted list
*
alternatively,
- works too
- 

~~The world is flat.~~ for a strike though,
**to bold**
*to itilicize* 

1. for a numbered list
2.

​```python

​```

for a code box, where 'python' can be whatever language you want syntax highlighting for

`single backticks (note, these aren't apostrophes) for in line code too`

> lets you make a block quote

markdown also lets you use inline HTML, so, depending on the intent to render out to a pdf or webpage, you may be able to embed YouTube Videos or Tweets or whatever like I have through out this guide.

| Tables | Can     |
| ------ | ------- |
| Be     | Made    |
| Like   | This    |

Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.

- [x] This is a task list
- [ ] As we go down this page
- [ ] Some of this syntax may not be supported

$ may let you type inline math in \LaTeX $, and $$$ for blocks, same as the code syntax

1^2 or 1~2 may let you write super and sub-script text as well.
```
