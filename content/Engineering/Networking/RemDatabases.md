TODO] Start with comparison to spreadsheet, explaining ‘NoSQL’ Vs ‘SQL’ and that this is Relational vs Non-Relational


As a programmer that began her career in DevOps and migrated to programming proper via OOP and databases, I feel like I may be a touch helpful here.

I would also like to say that it is indeed overused and, as much as a I enjoy SQL, it consumes an absurd amount of bandwidth for what it is(functional and efficient *where and when* it is called for) and what it is not (an all-in-one database solution). SQL should be learned because it is ubiquitous and (opinion) not because it is the "the best". Oracle has, for a long time, been worthy of criticism, especially with it all but being slapped down with Anti-Trust Law violation [probably good place for a link/blog discussing monopolies in Tech, Adobe, CISCO, Oracle, MSFT, etc…]

There is a lot of dogma in tech, however, even Venkat (a programmer and educator I look up to and have learned from over the years and is one of the most respected voices in the Java ecosystem)* has gone on record to say that there is no best programming language and that they are tools and one should use the tool best suited for the occasion.
[Add Twitter quote and link from Venkat saying languages are tools]

*Shorten this, Nikki or break it up

One should hope that you wouldn't try to use an Allen wrench when a hammer is ideal and despite my background, I wholeheartedly say that this is true for both the OOP paradigm and SQL/relational databases. A hummingbird does not need a jet engine to fly.
