If you&rsquo;re familiar with the hows and whys of spreadsheets, you&rsquo;re part way there to having a grasp on SQL&rsquo;s db&rsquo;s, actually&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t get comfortable though.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you&rsquo;re handling *a lot* of data, ranging from just a small business with daily foot traffic to international corporations, the amount of data that will be accessed daily, even on the most small scales imaginable (even sales from someone&rsquo;s shopify/etsy page), you still need to track a lot of information.<br></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17">Why databases?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Enter Sam, he&rsquo;s passionate about his culinary studies, *especially* baked goods; he is aware that his area lacks readily accessible treats and a very active mall has an opening with really reasonable rates for rent. Better yet, there&rsquo;s no Cookie Co, Mrs Fields, nor an Auntie Anne&rsquo;s within miles! Sam begins to create his plan.[Probably a good segue to small business venture articles]<br><br>Jumping forward, before Sam can even set prices, he has to know what prices to set for his goods and services. Business plan aside, he already needs a spreadsheet! <br><br>If you&rsquo;re already familiar with spreadsheets, you definitely realized by now that we&rsquo;re beyond the need of just one worksheet(spreadsheet in the general sense, table in the database sense). A workbook(database) can contain many worksheets, but running a business, especially one that accepts card payments and digital orders, requires *a lot*, a lot more than the typical workbook can handle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sam is busy, recording every transaction manually, especially at the volume of traffic of both digital and brick/mortar, is beyond unfeasible at this point. Especially for the sake of figuring future prices, deals, sales, when to buy more of an ingredient, how much to buy, which vendor to call, how much said orders would cost, when peak hours are, what sells best at those times, recording profits and losses for taxes, collecting emails for sending out coupons and offers and even dogearing goods between both fronts of the store for orders placed ahead of time! And this is just the beginning of what a small business needs to keep track of.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here, even Sam, with his Culinary Arts degree and daily/nightly baking, could have his book keeping stressors nearly entirely alleviated were he to pick up a database to carry the bookkeeping for him! Fortunately for him, he lives in 2023 and has access to our modern tools and databases. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">XTODO] Start with comparison to spreadsheetl</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Xspreadsheets versus SQL</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While the structure of both databases and spreadsheets share some things in common, the spreadsheet handles simple record keeping and managing concise amounts of data very well&ndash;&ndash;however databases are engineered for both searching and retrieving stored data across many tables and preparing the requested data however you want it, you can &lsquo;have it your way&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While spreadsheets may be more readily approachable and even help organize data from databases for presentations, databases can hold much more, by magnitudes; their forms, queries and reports also update as their tables do, no need to redo them. Interacting with databases may not be as straightforward, but their power is incredible.<br></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">Relational versus non-relational</span><span><br></span><span class="c4">What makes SQL databases relatable?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Relational databases are actually not a new thing! They have been in use since the 70&rsquo;s and didn&rsquo;t really see any competition until the 2000&rsquo;s with the appearance of non-relational databases as an answer to one of weaknesses of RDBMS (Relational Database Management System), the struggle of scalability as we moved to the cloud with services required to serve users from all over the Earth, thousands at a time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The relation between the tables of a relational database can best be imagined as the overlap of two or more circles in a complex venn diagram; the overlap being what would be duplicate data! The use of certain markers, particularly the </span><span class="c15">Primary and Foreign keys, establish relationships between many tables</span><span class="c0">&ndash;&ndash;these relations are part of what makes RDBMS database functions so powerful! Separate Tables can be joined in reports, filter by dates and return a report featuring nothing but one column from each table! </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>This probably doesn&rsquo;t sound like anything but it&rsquo;s so much better to have a table of unique order numbers, dates, and user IDs related to a general users table than somehow cramming a long list of order numbers into some fields in the Users Table. This allows for a relation to exist between the tables (User ID&rsquo;s) and query all the info of a user when they ask about their order from the Orders table with just a JOIN function(more on that in a bit)! No duplicate data, all data present has a place to be.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">When ACID met the BASE</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Some of the key properties of Relational databases are represented by the acronym ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) and conversely BASE (Basic Availability, Soft state, and Eventual consistency) represents the properties of the Non-relational databases.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><a id="t.ceb820194f7d99da16b693b8a8a5247dc88f9c4d"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c10"><tr class="c3"><td class="c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c11">Atomicity: </span><span class="c6">No actions are half-complete, if one part of an action cannot be done, no changes are made, definite success or failure.</span></p></td><td class="c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c11">Basic Availability</span><span class="c6">: The focus is not 100% data consistency at once; rather it ensures that the data is always accessible.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c3"><td class="c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c11">Consistency:</span><span class="c6">The database cannot change while performing a transaction and any data entering the database is made to be consistent with the set mechanisms and rules.

If it looks like table names are being referenced in the column space, it&rsquo;s because they are, actually.
