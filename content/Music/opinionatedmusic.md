# Opinionated Music

Hey there.

My name is Vega. I know there are plenty of tutorials and ways to learn online be it on YouTube, SkillShare, or online classes provided for free by various universities. The difference here is there is no bullshit, no babysitting, and lots of bias as a result of personal experience. My views of things like what music software is bad or what equipment you should buy to learn with will be expressed directly and bluntly. This isn't to say I won't explain my reasoning, just that I'm not going to be apologetic when I say a lot of the audiophile gear is trash or that hating on digital music is misguided - though I will still likely talk about these things.
