# Audio backends

[TODO]

## Windows

### ASIO

### Direct Sound

### WSAPI

## Linux

{{< hint gray>}}

Seriously check out [Making Sense of The Linux Audio Stack on Venam's Blog](https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2021/02/07/audio-stack.html). It's a rather painfully long read, but if you're trying to do Linux audio it's probably less painful than trying to figure it all out by stumbling though it.

### ALSA

### Pulse Audio

### Jack

{{< hint warning >}}

A few programs you wouldn't expect to run directly though jack, one of the more annoying is Telegram. To fix Telegram at least, just use `alsoft-config` and go to Backends->General, then right click Disabled backends and add JACK.
