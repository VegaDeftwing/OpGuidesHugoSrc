# Programmable Music Tools

<script>    document.getElementById("softMenu").open = true;</script>

<!-- TODO: Add https://github.com/ldrolez/clyphx-live10 -->

Before getting into this list, I also want to point out that there's an *endless* number of programmable music sequencing tools which can be found built into VST plugins, larger audio software, and even video games. I'm particularly fond of the huge number of interesting sequencers for VCV Rack, such as [Quad Algorithmic Rhythm Generator](https://library.vcvrack.com/FrozenWasteland/QuadAlgorithmicRhythm), [Entropia](https://library.vcvrack.com/Geodesics/Entropia), [Fate](https://library.vcvrack.com/Geodesics/Fate), [Marbles](https://library.vcvrack.com/AudibleInstruments/Marbles), and [Orca's Heart](https://library.vcvrack.com/scanner-darkly-collection-one/SDOrcasHeart) - just to name a few.

This list absolutely can not have everything. Still, I've tried to highlight some of the more novel ideas.

It's also worth mentioning, there are very interesting hardware tools such as the [monome norns](https://monome.org/norns/), and [Toroso T-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Ho3sKDJFg)

Finally, if you're into VJ work, you may want to check out {{< button relref="Design/gen" color="design" >}}The big list of generative art tools{{< /button >}} in the Design section of this website. If you're looking for hardware for this role, you may want to check out the [hypno](https://sleepycircuits.com/hypno) by Sleepy Circuits or the Critter & Guitari [Eyesy](https://www.critterandguitari.com/eyesy).

[Chuck](https://github.com/ccrma/chuck)

<--->

> Chuck is a programming language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation. It is open-source and freely available on MacOS X, Windows, and Linux. Chuck presents a unique time-based, a concurrent programming model that's precise and expressive (we call this strongly-timed), dynamic control rates, and the ability to add and modify code on-the-fly. In addition, ChucK supports MIDI, OpenSoundControl, HID device, and multi-channel audio.

[Pure-Data,](https://puredata.info) [Purr Data (a better fork),](https://agraef.github.io/purr-data/) [Plugdata (another fork)](https://plugdata.org/index.html) and [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max) (the one everyone uses in Ableton)

<--->

Max is *much* friendly and more useful than Pure Data, though it's also not FOSS.

Both are visual programming environments which are rather low level (much lower level than VCV Rack, for example) and so are less useful in a live context; however, they're extraordinarily powerful for making your own instruments which you can play live.

The reason I've grouped them together is that both Max and PD share the original author, [Miller Puckette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Puckette); however, it's very clear that PD has more or less stagnated while Max has grown

[Music Pattern Generator](https://github.com/hisschemoller/music-pattern-generator)

<--->

Music Pattern Generator is an app to create musical rhythms. It sends MIDI data, so it won’t make any sounds by itself. For that you need to connect it to MIDI soft- or hardware that can handle MIDI data to produce sound.
