# Misc Music Tips and Tricks

* Try sidechaining your effects against the dry input - you can duck your delays and verbs out of the way for fresh input while still keeping them spacious.
* In many DAWs you can view multiple MIDI clips at once or get MIDI from another track to appear as ghost notes on the track you want to edit - this is incredibly helpful for making one sequence in relation to another (Eg, melody & bass)
	* In Ableton, click the first clip, then shift click any additional clips you want to see simultaniously from other tracks.
