# Instruments

## What is an Instrument?

Okay, yeah, that sounds like a stupid question, but I think it's important to think about. Wikipedia has it defined like this:

{{< quote "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument)" >}}

A **musical instrument** is a device created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument.

{{< /quote >}}

which, okay, that's fair enough. But I think that has some issues. For one, not all devices that are played as instruments make sounds on their own. I have quite a few MIDI controllers sitting next to me, and while they send data about the notes I'm playing, they do not make sounds on their own- are they still instruments?

So, for the purposes of these pages I'll consider an instrument to be defined not solely by sound, but by the interface. This may seem like an odd choice, but it is because technology has brought use to a point that it is often extraordinarily difficult to determine what interface is being used. I can play a guitar and hear a piano, I can play drums and hear a violin. The sounds, to some extent, have been decoupled from their physical forms.

*Obviously*, some interfaces are still better than others for making certain sounds. While I could detect each drum hit on a set of acoustic drums and map each to a different note on the piano, this will be far from a good way to play the piano, and may make playing chords impossible. Similarly, I could map drum sounds to each key on a keyboard (and this is often done) but it's rather awkward to play.

In the first few chapters, <a href="/music/music-getting-started/">Getting Started</a> and <a href="/music/sound-sources/">Sound Sources</a>, synthesizers were explored rather deeply - so why do this before talking about the more familiar realm of acoustic instruments, like a big ol' hollow body guitar or a drum set with membrane you can hit and *feel*?

Well, because assuming you know how all of the physics of those systems work *or* have really good samples of the instruments *or* you only need to fill the same role as the sound (like needing a bass-heavy sound, but not a bass guitar) it really doesn't matter if you have the physical instrument, so long as you have a good way to play the same sounds, that lends the same amount of expressiveness and control.

### Expressiveness and Control

So, what do I mean "expressiveness and control"?

Well, think about the difference between a piano and a guitar. On a piano, you may have hugely more strings, but you can only vary a few things (how hard you hit them, weather or not they get muted when you release the key) but on a guitar you can bend the strings, mute them with you hand, pluck them with different intensities, slide between notes, play hammer-on notes (play the next note on the string without plucking), etc. The guitar, despite it's lack of strings, is often a much more expressive instrument than the piano.

So, this may seem like a no brainer, acoustic instruments offer more hands-on control and sound better than digital ones right?

Well, most digital instruments give you a huge number of knobs than can be tweaked to get the sound exactly as you want, but that's often not a fair comparison because it would be really hard to get a sound like a guitar if you hard to simultaneously play the notes on a MIDI keyboard and turn a huge number of knobs to match the same motion on a real guitar.

Fortunately, this isn't what playing digital instruments has to look like anymore. 

There are plenty of expressive digital controllers, that allow for just as much, if not more, control as a traditional acoustic instrument would. Here, for example, is a track played on the Roli Seaboard, which is a squishy keyboard where the pressure applied by each finger, how hard you strike initially, the vertical position of the finger all matter *and* the play can easily drag the finger across notes or wiggle their finger for a vibrato.

### "I'm a Guitarist/Drummer/Violinist and this isn't right!"

Woah there, I'm not saying your skills with a particular instrument are worthless or that knowing how to play an instrument well is a bad thing!

I'm saying musicians shouldn't be tied to their instrument. At most, you should be focused on your musical position. A drummer shouldn't have to use acoustic drums to be a drummer, using a mix of a drum machine and MIDI drums should be seen as valid option. Similarly, a bassist shouldn't be tied to their guitar. Often people couple the sound to the instrument, but there's really no need to do so anymore. It used to be that trying to 'fake' a bass guitar sound with a keyboard meant that you just can't replicate everything the bass could do because a keyboard inherently lacks the control of the metal strings that you can bend, slap, and otherwise abuse. However, now with the expressiveness of modern controllers and the timbral diversity and quality of synthesizers, is basically the same (if not better) than that of any other instrument, and you gain the ability to explore sounds that would otherwise be impossible to reach on the acoustic instrument.

Emulations of sounds aren't bad, the interface to them was. That's changed in the last few years.

There are limitations imposed by physical instruments that we're used to hearing, like a guitars limit of 6-note polyphony as well as imperfections - like the background hum and string noise of an electric guitar or acoustic respectively. But, all of those can be (and are) emulated very well regularly, because just like vinyl they can be pleasant.

The value of the musician should be in their ability to inspire composition as they know how to push the sounds of their instrument and how to get the most out of those limitations, and if that's the case, why should it matter if they're using a 400 year old $100,000 violin or a good physically modeled synth- especially if even trained ears can not hear the difference, or think the digital one sounds 'more real' on a regular basis. If they can use the knowledge from playing a physical, acoustic instrument and augment it with the flexibility and power of synthesis I see that as an absolute win.

I still play my guitar, and I still record it into finished music, but I don't necessarily think it's superior to using that squishy keyboard, and I own one of those squishy keyboards along with my very expensive guitar. I do it because it's **fun**. Similarly, it can be fun to watch- I think one of the big appeals of an orchestra is it's spectacle. So, no, your skills with traditional instruments aren't going anywhere and there's still many good reasons to learn.

Three more things:

1. The physical limitations of an instrument will inspire how it is played. A drum machine can be programmed to have patterns that a real drummer could never do, but this isn't always a good thing. **Knowing both will make you better at both.**
2. Without proper respect for a digital instrument, it will sound just as bad as poorly played physical one. Just as it takes skill to play instruments with [varying dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpqObbD2YqE) the same applies to digital instruments.
3. Just as players in an real ensemble have to interpret notes and add their own 'flair' to what they see as part of the translation from paper to sound, so do players of digital instruments- the problem here is that a computer will be extremely *sterile*- do not expect to just place notes on a digital piano roll and get anywhere near the same quality. If you want it to sound like it's played by a human, you need to **actually play it** - even if the controller doesn't match the sound (guitar sound on a keyboard or whatever)

## Percussion

### Theory

Before I even dive into Percussion, I think it's necessary to point out how generic the term is. Just looking at the Wikipedia page for drum kit you'll see this:

<img src="/drumkit.png" alt="wikipedia drum kit list" height="500em">

{{< attribution >}}[Drum Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit) page on Wikipedia{{< /attribution >}}

and clearly that's still not an exhaustive list. Just off the top of my head I can see it lacks the Cajon or Taiko as acoustic instruments, let alone anything more specific than electronic drum, which can make for a class all its own.

Wikipedia defines [Percussion Instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_instrument) as "a musical instrument that is sounded by being struck or scraped by a beater including attached or enclosed beaters or rattles struck, scraped or rubbed by hand or struck against another similar instrument." but, frankly, I think that definition really sucks. I think a better definition would be any tool that be used to make a sound with a sharp attack, that is typically not pitched/tuned and is used to establish the tempo of the song. I confess that this definition is still bad, but hey, it's better. Generally though, I think we all have a sort of intimate knowledge of what percussion is and I'm not trying to turn this page into one on the philosophy of music or human experience, so let's jump back into my definition a bit- I said it (loosly) requires a sharp attack. What do I mean by that? Well, remember back when we looked at the ADSR in getting started?

{{< columns >}}

Here's that original ADSR gif again, see how the first stage, the attack can vary in time. If we imagine this as the volume of the sound, one with a more gradual fade in, instead of a vertical line, will have a smooth fade in. This is not how most percussive sounds are used. Usually, a percussive sound has a very loud **transient** and, usually, a short decay. Basically, the drum hit's hard, fast, and goes away fast.

![](/adsr.gif)

<--->

Look at this view of a bass drum hit on a scope. See how there's this sharp spike, right as it first starts? Also, see how it only moves up and down a few times before fading out? Think about this like smacking the head of a drum, you get that sharp hit, then the drum head will oscillate back and forth a few times before coming to rest. What's also of note is those peaks aren't evenly spaced. It's actually gets lower pitch as it fades out (albeit not by much here). A lot of percussion does this, changing in pitch over it's short lifespan.

![](/bassdrum.png)

{{< /columns >}}

It's also pretty common for percussion to have a noisy part to it, literally just 'polluting' the entire frequency spectrum. That's really obvious here with both the snare and open hi-hat sounds, where on the scope you can see the jittery-ness of the noise: 

![](/hatbasssnare.png)

It's also worth noting just how clean of a sine wave the bass drum is. This isn't necessarily *required* of the lower pitch drums, but most bass sounds- drums or not- tend to sound muddy if anything but a pure sine wave. 

{{< columns >}}

If you're wondering what the difference is between the snare and the hat given how similar they look in the waveform: the hat only really fills the 5khz to 20kHz range, with a peak around 6khz while the snare goes down to 320Hz (ish), with noise spreading up to 20khz as well, but with a strong peak at that 320Hz point.

Alright, so this is nice and all, but, like, this is a guide about sound and that's a lot of pictures? Let's dive in then. I've put together a VCV patch for you to learn on. It has a ton of notes built in and focuses on the sound design side of percussion, as we'll come back to actually sequencing drums (making patterns of drum hits, or playing them with sticks, whatever) in a bit, but I think it helps just to get a feel for how much sound design can go into percussion.

{{< tip >}}

To open this patch, you'll need to have VCV with the packs BogAudio, Audible Instruments, Befaco, Valley, Vult Free, Fehler Fabrik, Starling Via, MindMeld, Hora Processors Free, Geodesics, Aria Salvatrice, Erica Synths, Stoermelder, and  Submarine. All of these are free.

{{< /tip >}}

<--->

![drum patch screenshot](/drumpatchscreenshot.jpg)

The patch can be downloaded from patch storage [here](https://patchstorage.com/percussion-explainer/).

{{< /columns >}}

So just download this patch and poke around for a while. A big part of learning music is having a sort of mental catalog of sounds that you can make and how they can work together. The best way to build up this mental catalog is to experiment, that's why while this patch is pre-wired, I encourage you to twist and turn every knob. After all, worst case you just re-open the original file and start over. So experiment! Find weird sounds!

{{< columns >}}

Once you've done that, go ahead and try to make your own drum sound using basic modules (Oscilators, VCAs, etc.), thinking about the characteristics of the sounds you made and what I explained above, if you need a bit of an example for that, go ahead and check out this patch.

(if you need a little push, you might try out [Befaco's Percall](https://library.vcvrack.com/Befaco/Percall), which makes it pretty easy to get drum sounds out of any oscillator)

You might want to go back to sound sources and look at subtractive and FM synthesis again if you're still a bit rusty on how to make patches from scratch.

When you've had your fill come back and we'll talk about some common percussive kits, that is sounds that you'll find together either in an acoustic drum kit or on an electronic drum machine. Then we can wrap percussion up by briefly diving into making drum patterns- though that will be covered more in depth in Chapter 5, <a href="/music/sequencing-and-midi/">Sequencing & MIDI</a>.

Welcome back, Hope you had fun messing around in that patch! Let's dive into percussion kits then.

### Your Standard Drum Kit

I mentioned right at the start that theres a huge range of common percussion instruments. There's anything from the hexagonal drums on the giant drum sets of the 1980's to the marching drums you see played on the field. While there's no rules in music and I'm a huge fan of doing things in new and original ways, it still helps to have an idea of which of these drums sounds are most commonly used together.

When you think of drums, you *probably* think of the standard acoustic drum kit like is portrayed in that Wikipedia screenshot from the beginning, so let's start by breaking that down into it's parts

* **Bass Drum + Pedal**
{{< columns >}}

This is the Big Ol' drum on the floor, the one that often has the band's logo on it. Sometimes it's called the Kick Drum, and it's usally hit with a beater pedal.

This is the main drum everyone obsesses over, because it's (usually) the one that people are going to tap along to and sets the tempo of the track.

I do want to point out that it's not just the drum that matters, but also the beater. [Especially in metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OptsiOhFW5c), you'll often see [Double Bass Drum Pedals](https://www.sweetwater.com/c651--Double_Drum_Pedals__and__Beaters).

* **Snare Drum**
{{< columns >}}

This is the shallowest drum, usually about 6 inches deep. The snare is also used for rimshots, coming back to that in a bit. It's also pretty common to add extra things to the snare to spice it up:

* **Floor Tom**
  {{< columns >}}
  Your 'Normal' drum set will have 3 Tom drums, these are big, deep drums. Of them, the Floor Tom is the biggest.
  <---> 

  See the video below to hear a Tom drum in action

{{< /columns >}}

---
* **Toms (usually X2)**
{{< columns >}}
The other two drums on 'Normal' drum kit are toms too, but are typically a bit smaller, but not matched in size. Usually this is set up so you can have "Descending Toms" - more on this in a bit.

* **Crash, Ride, Splash, and China Cymbals**
  {{< columns >}}
  This is basically a big disc of metal made to flop noise around everywhere, right? Well, it turns out there's a little more nuance to it than that. Here's a really informative link and an interesting video comparing some Cymbals. My point is just that there's more to it than a slab of metal.

### Other Percussion Elements

Don't forget that percussion doesn't just have to come from stretched membranes and sheets of metal. Shakers, finger snaps, the triangle, gongs, bells, hang drums, claps ... this list keeps going. Don't be afraid to add some spice!

### The 808, 909, LinnDrum, and Oberheim DMX

[TODO]

### Modern Drum Machines

Most modern drum machines actually have a bit more than drums. The Elektron Digitakt, for example, is a sampling drum machine that can take those samples down to single cycle wave forms and loop them, turning it into a synth- and a quite competent one at that.
