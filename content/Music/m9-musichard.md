# Music Hardware

Digital: 1010111010010010110100101110101

Analog: ∿∿\~∿\~∿∿∿~

## MIDI

[TODO] [Building a MIDI Controller Using Arduino (YouTube, Switch & Lever)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ5yPdoPooU)

MPE, aftertouch, vel, virtual midi, midi cc v pb v mod v note on/off v sysmsg v OSC v midi2.0

Note, there's a pretty limited number of MPE capable instruments, thankfully there's stil a decent price range between them. This list is not exhaustive, but I think gives a good sampling:

## Audio Interfaces

[TODO, ADAT, preamps, headphone amps, phantom48, Hi-Z, Lo-Z]

> Weird side note:
>
> Some VOIP software (Discord, Zoom, etc.) may want you to use a Sample rate of 48Khz and a Buffer size of 192. No clue why.

## Headphones/speakers

[TODO studio headphones V regular]

[TODO openback v Closed]

[TODO Planar magnetic]

[TODO Quadraphonic, Atmos, 5.1, etc]

## Eurorack

[Modular Grid](https://www.modulargrid.net/) an online tool for dreaming about hardware setups (Eurorack, Guitar Pedals, and a few other modular formats)

## Notes on Hardware **NOT** to buy

* The Teenage Engineering Pocket Operators are cool, fun, etc. But they're pretty fragile and have some issues. Generally, I don't think they're worth it. Here's Some alternatives
  * [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket/)
  * [DityWave M8](https://dirtywave.com)
  * or, if you're feeling spendy, the OP-1 and OP-Z are options. Each have their own quirks though, so be sure to do your research. Regardless, I really don't recomend the TE PO's

## Notes on how your hardware will be more expensive than you think

[TODO] Balanced audio, group loop isolation, impedance matching, isolated power supplies, cables ... so many cables

## DAWless?

DAW-less just means not using a Digital Audio Workstation to make your music, usually though this means not using a typical computer at all. Here's a good example of a DAWless performance:
