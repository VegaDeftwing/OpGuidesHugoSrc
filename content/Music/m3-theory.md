# Theory

I'm going to be honest. I can't read music and I don't know scales. Why, then, would I in any way think I'm qualified to write anything about music? Well, let me stop you right there, I'm not. I make music for fun. However, I like to think that people enjoy my music and I enjoy listening to it myself as I make it, and though my experience I've picked up a little here and there to make sure things don't sound awful. Furthermore, my background is primarily technically and there's actually an insane amount of overlap with the incredibly technical and music. Fundamentally music is just doing math with frequencies after all.

Our ears are weird. They're incredibly good at math. We hear things logarithmically, that's why 10watts of speaker output power is only about twice as loud as 1watt and we can tell if two notes are even slightly off a perfect ratio even if we're not thinking about it. (If you hear one tone at 220Hz and another at 441Hz, only 1hz off of correct, you'll probably be able to tell)

Out ears also like integer divisions of musical ratios- I'm sure you've heard the term 'perfect fifth'. And though our lives our ears get accustomed to hearing and feeling things associated with chord progressions. Even someone whose never written music or tried to learn anything about music theory can pick up on how a chord with more complex ratios creates tension that begs to be resolved to something simper (Think the Duuun-uh of the Jaw's theme).

On the other hand perfection is boring, our ears and minds beg for stimulation, for surprise, for shock. Drums make complex sounds, that, while tuned, aren't playing a constant note and we want our music to have sufficient progression, not just repeat the same sequence endlessly. A gnarly drop in some Dubstep or the cannon fire in the 1812 Overture both serve functionally a similar purpose.

The most common scale worldwide, the chromatic scale, uses 12 notes in an octave tuned to an equal temperament [TODO link] as to make as many chords as possible sound good is by far the most common but only one of an infinite ways that music can be represented. On the extreme end is Microtonal music, such as is possible on fretless [TODO link guitar, and this keyboard https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APtJsaPxNgo] instruments. Furthermore, our choice of centering out keyboard with A set to 440Hz is relatively arbitrary (not that it's a bad thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKTZ151yLnk).

In the chromatic scale there are many other, more 'refined' scales like Minor, Major, Pentatonic, etc. These scales may be transposed to be centered around any note (or any frequency, since notes are just agreed upon frequencies and the ratios between them)

And honestly? That's about all you need to know. Basically music is math and math makes music.

Oh, and the circle of fifths is a thing [TODO]
