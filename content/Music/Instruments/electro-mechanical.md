# Electro-Mechanical Instruments

I have a particular love of instruments that sit in that acoustic sweet spot where i feels as though there's a physical resonating body merged with a synthesizer, where you can hear key clicks and a physical body but it doesn't respond like we're used to yet it's not so avant-garde as not not be useful or just a gimmick.

Think a hurdy gurdy, but with an inbuilt tube amp and the drones are actually tube based oscillators.

I have only found a few instruments that scratch this itch for me and so want to give them a chance in the spotlight:

* [Korg Phase 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dawpiUX0ZWk)
* [RR Sparkgap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqGavA-Movk)
* [Fluidshell Seraphim](https://www.fluidshell.com/unconventional-instruments/seraphim)

Honorable Mentions

* RR Hurdy Gurdy + Dist Tube Culture?

Dishonorable mentions

* Gamchanger Plasma Voice & Plasma Drive
* Gamechanger Motor synth
