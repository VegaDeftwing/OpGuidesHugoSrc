# Solarpunk Home Plans

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css_overrides/light.css">

As I write the first draft of this page - which, hopefully, by the time you're reading has had many updates - I am 26. In the next year or two, I will probably be buying a home once I have the highest interest student loans laid to rest.

Buying a house is strange to me, because I hold this sort of cognitive dissonance.

On one hand, I like the idea of compact, shared housing, communal gardens, bikeable cities, etc. and want to actively prove, though my personal choices, that those are things I value.

On the other, I need to not be throwing money into the bottomless pit that is rent, I like to play music which requires room to make noise without pissing of the neighbors, and, on that note,

I'd need people to be *communal* with. I need a *community* for a community garden. The densest places we commonly see in the US, apartments, are ... not that.

I have tried to get to know some of my neighbors where I am, but *o o f* . It. Is. Rough.

And, like, to some extent that makes sense. I'm not, at least to my knowledge, around anyone that even shares those values.

So, that leaves me to do it myself, so,

## Things I need

* Community + Friends
  * Barring being able to find an ultra-green, liberal, niece to fall into I will make it happen by finding others like me. I want roommates, so long as they're people I vibe with. I already plan to be with my fantastic SO, of course, but I would love to find others that can help split financial burden. I don't want to be a land lord, but I don't want to make some mess down the line with ownership either. So, I haven't yet figured out what the "renting" situation may look like for others. Maybe it would just be ""free"" but they need to buy/prep/grow food for those paying for the land/home? I don't know.
  * I would like to be near a hacker space which I can frequent and contribute to.
* Power generation
  * I use a *lot* of electricity. Fortunately, here in Nebraska, our electricity is cheap (~$0.10 kw/h), but I want a way to generate my own.
    * I may not choose to stay in Nebraska. It's *fine* here, but Colorado would be so, so much nicer.
  * Solar, if I do it, I think I'd want to be done with a [concentrator](https://github.com/remipch/solar_concentrator).
  * Wind, if I do it, I think I'd want to DIY to a few of the DNA lookin' ones.
  * Avoiding power usage is #1 priority, so I'd like to have plans to use lower-energy home heating/cooling solutions.
* Monitoring
  * I would like per-circuit power monitoring, to really watch my usage and better regulate the heavy hitters
  * Air quality matters a lot to me. I want monitoring in all major spaces of air quality, including CO2.
    * I want to try to keep CO2 levels under 800ppm everywhere, always.
* Food
  * Gardens, obviously. I need to look into how much can be done indoors so it's all year.
    *  [r/SpaceBuckets](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceBuckets/) (While really into one particular kind of plant) looks like it could be a good place to learn.
  * If I choose to live in town - which I would prefer - I need to figure out if I want any livestock (Chickens, probably)
  * Having a lil' apiary would be neat. At least here in Lincoln [it should be legal](https://online.encodeplus.com/regs/lincoln-ne/doc-viewer.aspx?secid=8028#secid-8028).
* Radio
  * I am a ham, and I'd like a nice radio setup. I don't particularly want to host a repeater, but I would like to have a pretty cool setup to do radio experimentation. I'll need to figure out what I want for antennas and how to do all of that shtuff.
